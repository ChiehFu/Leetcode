title: 263. Ugly Number
tags: Math, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:
```
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
```
Note:

- 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
- Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].

Thoughts:
1. Iterate through the prime numbers:
      1. For each prime number, if the input number `num` is a multiple of the prime number, divide it by the `num` by the prime number until it's not.
2. After looping through all prime number, check if `num` is `1`:
   1. if it's not, means it has other prime factors, return false.
   2. Otherwise, return true.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if (num < 1) return false;
        
        while (num && num % 2 == 0) num /= 2;
        while (num && num % 3 == 0) num /= 3;
        while (num && num % 5 == 0) num /= 5;
        if (num != 1) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```c++
//Generalized for k prime factors
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return false;
        vector<int> prime{2, 3, 5};
        for (int n : prime) {
            while (num % n == 0) num /= n;
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
};
```
