title: 55. Jump Game
tags: medium, Greedy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

Thoughts:
1. Scan through the nums array and keep track of the farthest position we can reach by jump from previous position `i` with `nums[i]` steps.
2. For each position `i` check if we can reach, and update the farthest position we can reach at this point.
 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_reach_pos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // If we can't reach this pos by jumping from any of the previous position, return false
            if (i > max_reach_pos) return false;
            // Update the farthest position we can reach
            max_reach_pos = max(max_reach_pos, i + nums[i]);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

```Java

class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
    	if (nums.length == 0) 
    		return false;
    	
    	int len = nums.length;
    	int nextReachablePosition = len - 1;
    	for (int i = len - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    		if (i + nums[i] >= nextReachablePosition) {
    			nextReachablePosition = i;
    		}
    	}
    	
        return nextReachablePosition == 0;
    }
}
```
