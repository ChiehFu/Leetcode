A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: 10
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 2
Output: 20
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 3
Output: 46
 ```

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 5000

----------
Thoughts:
1. For the value `v` of Nth dial, the number of distinct numbers that ends with `v` will be the sum of the number of the way of the value `i` on `(N-1)th` dial that can reach value `v`.
2. Solution 1: Use `dp[n][i][j]` to represent the number of distinct numbers with the length of `n` and ends with the value at position `(i, j)` in the original `4 x 3 2D vector`.
    1. Use diecrtion vector with 8 diecrtions, for value at position `(i, j)`, check it's 8 possible next values (could be out of boundary or invalid position) when we updating the number of ways for value at position `(i, j)`
    2. Time: O(N * 12(positions) * 8(directions))
3. Solution2: Use `dp[n][val]` to represent the number of distinct numbers with the length of `n` and ends with number `val`(instead of useing coordinates(i, j))
    1. Use a vector of size 10 such that `v[val]` will store the numbers that can be reached from `val`.
    2. For value `i`, sum up every number of ways of the value `j` from `(N-1)th` dial that can reach i at `Nth` dial
    3. Time: O(N * 10), don't have to check all 8 diecrtion as we already figured out the valid values that can be reached and store in the vactor
