Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iteratively replacing the number until it becomes `1`.
2. Use a hash set to store the intermediate result, if we encounter any duplicate intermediate result, it means the number is not a happy number and we will be trapped in the loop, return false directly. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        while (n != 1) {
            if (seen.count(n)) return false;
            seen.insert(n);
            int tmp = 0;
            while (n) {
                tmp += pow(n % 10, 2);
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = tmp;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
