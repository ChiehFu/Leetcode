title: 721. Accounts Merge
tags: Union find, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Explanation: 
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```
Note:

- The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
- The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
- The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].

----------
Thoughts:
1. For each account in accounts, pick one email as parent email
   1. Store the mapping between the parent email and the account name
   2. find the parent email of other emails in the acount, and mount them unoder the current parent email
2. Iterate through all the eamils, group them by their parent (and use set to sort the order)
3. Iterate through the groups, find the account name by the parent of each group, and push the name with the emails into the result vector

```c++
//Time: O(NlogN), N = number of emails
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& accounts) {
        for (auto &account : accounts) {
            // Pick the first one's parent as the mainParent for this account
            string mainParent = find(account[1]);
            
            // Map mainParent to  the accout name
            emailToName_[mainParent] = account[0];
            
            // Union other emails to this mainParent
            for (int i = 2; i < account.size(); i++) {
                parent_[find(account[i])] = mainParent;
            }
        }
        
        // Group the email by their parent, and sort the eamils of each group by set
        unordered_map<string, set<string>> groups;
        for (auto &account : accounts) {
            for (int i = 1; i < account.size(); i++) {
                groups[find(account[i])].insert(account[i]);
            }
        }
        vector<vector<string>> res;
        for (auto &group : groups) {
            vector<string> acc = {emailToName_[group.first]}; //account name
            acc.insert(end(acc), begin(group.second), end(group.second));
            res.emplace_back(acc);
        }
        return res;
    }
    string find(string &e) {
        if (parent_[e] == "") return parent_[e] = e;
        return (parent_[e] == e)? e : parent_[e] = find(parent_[e]);
    }
private:
    unordered_map<string, string> emailToName_;
    unordered_map<string, string> parent_;
};
```
