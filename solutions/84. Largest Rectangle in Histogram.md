tags: Stack, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

Thoughts:

**Key Observation:**
1. For the `ith` histogram with height `h`, 
2. If the `(i+1)th` histogram next to it has the height `w`, such that `w > h`
   1. The height `h` of `ith` histogram can be covered by the height `w` of `(i+1)th` histogram, so height `h` and width `(i+1) - i + 1` can form a rectangle.
3. If the `(i+1)th` histogram next to it has the height `w`, and `w < h`, the width of the `ith` histogram can't be extended anymore, and we need to calculate the how much area it can form so far.
4. Use a stack to achieve the process above:
   1. Iterate over the histograms array, and push the index of the histogram into the stack as long as the current histogram can cover the histogram on the top of the stack (or if the stack is empty)
   2. Once we meet a histogram `A` that is shorter than the one `B` on the top of the stack, meaning that the height of `B` can't be covered any more, pop it out and calculate the area it can form so far as follow:
      1. The distance of the histogram `B` can extended will be : ``` dis = (current iterating index) - (the index of the second histogram from the top (-1 if doesn't exist)) - 1.``` 
      2. Calculate the area and keep the best. 
   3. . After the iteration, there might be some histograms left in the stack because the height of those histograms can be covered by every histogram after them.
      1. Fix the iterating index as `n + 1`, where `n = the size of the input array`, and pop out the histograms from the stack and perform steps `ii.a and ii.b` for each of them.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        stack<int> s;
        int max_rec = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            while (!s.empty() && heights[i] < heights[s.top()]) {
                int index = s.top(); s.pop();
                int dis = i - ((s.empty())? -1:s.top()) - 1;
                max_rec = max(max_rec, dis * heights[index]);
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        // Pop out every histogram left in the stack and calculate the area for it
        while (!s.empty()) {
            int index = s.top(); s.pop();
            int dis = heights.size() - ((s.empty())? -1:s.top()) - 1;
            max_rec = max(max_rec, dis * heights[index]);
        }
        return max_rec;
    }
};
