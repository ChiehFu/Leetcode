Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1

----------
Thoughts:
1. To find the next possible permutation in the alphabetical order, scan the string backward and find the first character `a` at position `i` that breaks the ascending order as we move backward.
2. Scan from `end ~ i` again to find the smallest character `b` greater than `a`, swap `a` with `b`.
3. Since we replace `a` at `b` with one greater character, reverse the later portion of the string `i + 1 ~ end` to make it smallest.
4. If we can not find any character in step 1, mean current string is the greatest permutation, and eventually we will just reverse the whole string to make it smallest.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = nums.size() - 1;
        while (i > 0 && nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) i--;
        if (i > 0) {
            int j = nums.size() - 1;
            while (j < nums.size() && nums[j] <= nums[i - 1]) j--;
            swap(nums[i - 1], nums[j]);
        }
        reverse(nums.begin() + i, nums.end());
    }
};
```
