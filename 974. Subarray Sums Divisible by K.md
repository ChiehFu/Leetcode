Given an array A of integers, return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays that have a sum divisible by K.

Example 1:

```
Input: A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by K = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
```

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 30000
- -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
- 2 <= K <= 10000

----------
Thoughts:
1. To finding the sum of subarray, we can categorize it into two kinds:
   1. Prefix array, where array = `nums[0, i], 0 <= i < n`
   2. Subarray, where array = `nums[i, j], 0 < i <= j < n<`
2. Use a accumulate array `acc` such that `acc[i] = sum(nums[0, i])` to find the sum of every prefix array.
3. And we can find the sum of the subarray `sum(nums[i, j)]` by calculating the difference between two prefix arrays `sum(nums[i, j)] = acc[j] - acc[i - 1]`.
4. Having the accumulate array, we can simplify the question two a two sum problem, where we want to find how many pairs in `acc` that the difference between them is divisible by `K`(i.e., the difference between two values having the same modulo value with `K` will be divisible by `K`)
5. Use a hash table to store each modulo value we've seen and how many prefix sums having that modulo value.


```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(K)

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        m[0] = 1;
        int count = 0;
        int acc = 0;
        // accumulate the sum in acc
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
            acc += A[i];

            // calculate the modulo value
            int t = acc % K;
            // In c++, '%' is a remainder operator, turn it into modulo if the number is negative
            if (t < 0) t += K;

            // All prefix sum having same modulo value can make a pair
            count += m[t];

            // Increase the number of prefix sum of the corresponding modulo value in the hash table by 1
            m[t]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
