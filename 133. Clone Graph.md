Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example: \
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png)


```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 ```

Note:

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
4. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

----------
Thoughts:
1. To avoid copying the same vertex multiple times, use a hahsmap to map the old to new vertex.
2. DFS/BFS traverse the graph, if current vertex has been copied, return that copied node.
3. Push the verteices returned from neighbors into the neighbors array of current new vertex
4. The additional hashmap can served as a visited hashset, which tells us if we already visit this node (if there is a mapping node)
