title: 904. Fruit Into Baskets

In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].

**You start at any tree of your choice,** then repeatedly perform the following steps:

Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.

You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

Example 1:
```c++
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
```

Example 4:
```c++
Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
```

Note:

- 1 <= tree.length <= 40000
- 0 <= tree[i] < tree.length

----------
Thoughts:

Solution 1:
1. Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window, use a hash table to keep track of the kind of the fruits and the number of each fruit in the basket.
2. If there are two fruits in the basket already, move the left pointer to remove fruit from the basket and update the hash table until there is a space for the current fruit we want to add.
3. Measure the length of the window and record the best of it which will be the answer.
4. Use vector given that the fruit id `tree[i]` is under the range `0 <= tree[i] < tree.length`

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(2) -> O(1) 

class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& tree) {
        int amount = 0;
        int type = 0;
        vector<int> types(tree.size(), 0);
        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < tree.size(); right++) {
            if (types[tree[right]] == 0) type++;
            types[tree[right]] += 1;
            while (left < right && type > 2) {
                int cur = tree[left];
                types[cur]--;
                if (types[cur] == 0) type--;
                left++;
            }
            amount = max(amount, right - left + 1);
        }
        return amount;
    }
};

```

Solution 2:
1. Instead of increasing the left pointer to remove the fruit one by one, we can store the last index of each fruit in the basket, so that when we want to remove all fruit `a` out of the basket, we just set `left = last_index[a] + 1`.

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(2) -> O(1) 

//With hash map
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& tree) {
        int total = 0;
        // {fruit, last index}
        unordered_map<int, int> idx;
        
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < tree.size()) {
            if (!idx.count(tree[r])) {
                if (idx.size() == 2) {
                    auto p1 = idx.begin();
                    auto p2 = p1++;             
                    if (p1->second > p2->second) swap(p1, p2);
                    l = p1->second + 1;
                    idx.erase(p1);
                }
            }
            idx[tree[r]] = r;
            total = max(total, r - l + 1);
            r++;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};

//With two pairs
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& tree) {
        int total = 0;
        // {fruit type, last index}
        pair<int, int> p1{-1,-1}, p2{-1,-1};
        
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < tree.size()) {
            if (tree[r] == p1.first) {
                p1.second = r;
            } else if (tree[r] == p2.first) {
                p2.second = r;
            } else if (p1.first == -1) {
                p1 = {tree[r], r};
            } else if (p2.first == -1) {
                p2 = {tree[r], r};
            } else {
                if (p1.second < p2.second) {
                    swap(p1, p2);
                }
                l = p2.second + 1;
                p2 = {tree[r], r};
            }
            
            total = max(total, r - l + 1);
            r++;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};
