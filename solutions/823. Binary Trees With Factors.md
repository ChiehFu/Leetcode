title: 823. Binary Trees With Factors
tags: Dynamic Programming, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.

We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.

Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.

How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
```
Example 1:

Input: A = [2, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
```

```
Example 2:

Input: A = [2, 4, 5, 10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
```
 

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 1000.
- 2 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9.

---------- 
Thoughts:
1. Each number in `A` can ba a root, and if the value of it happens to be the product of other values that also exist in `A`, we can make a tree from them.
2. Let `dp[i]` be the number of the binary trees with factors of the root node `i`, we can notice the following relation:
    ```
    dp[j] = sum(dp[a] * dp[b]), for a in A and b in A.
    ``` 
3. Use `long` type for `result` to avoid integer overflow.


    ```Java
    //Time: O(N ^ N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
        public int numFactoredBinaryTrees(int[] A) {
            int module = (int)Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
            Arrays.sort(A);
            Map<Integer, Long> dp = new HashMap<>();
            long result = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
                dp.put(A[i], 1L);
                
                for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                    if (A[i] % A[j] == 0) {
                        dp.put(A[i], dp.get(A[i]) + dp.get(A[j]) * dp.getOrDefault(A[i] / A[j], 0L));
                    }
                }
                result = (result + dp.get(A[i])) % module;
            }
            
            return (int) result;
        }
    }
    ```
