Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

 
```
Example:
Input: 
board = [
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]

words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
 ```

Note:
    All inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
    The values of words are distinct.

1. Build the Trie to store all string, use the Trie for DFS to avoid repeatedly searching the string having same prefix.
2. Traverse the Trie based on the DFS order of the characters in the board
   1. Use DFS to search board and pass the current trie node which represent the current compared character.
   2. If the current trie node is not null (which means there is a match), go deeper.
   3. If the current trie node is the end of some string, which means we've found a match of a string, push that string into the result

**Time complexity :**
- For the naive Trie approach (the one uses startwith and search), I think the time complexity is O(m * n * wl * 4^wl) where m*n is the size of the board and wl is the average length of the words in the list. For this optimized approach, it becomes O(m * n * 4^wl). Please correct me if you think I am wrong.
- This I think is correct. With the trie, we don't care about iterating each word, but we rather just loop through each element in the matrix and then for each element we try to traverse the trie when ever there is a match. for each path there are 4 ways, and each of the 4 ways taken is terminated once we reach the wl, hence 4^wl. The worst case is every element in the mtraix allows the traversal of the trie hence mn4^wl
