Question:
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:
```c++
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```c++
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. To find the median, we have to find a way to divide the combination of the two arrays into left and right partitions such that the median will be the:
   1. The average of the last one of left partition and the fist one of right partition, if `total size` is even number
   2. The first one of right partition if `total size` is odd number
2. Fix the size of left partition array to be `total / 2` so that the right partition will be equal to or greater than the left partition by 1 depending on the parity of `total size`
3. Pick the smaller array as `array1`.
   1. Why pick the smaller as the basis to do binary search? 
      1. It guarantees that:
         1. `array2` is at least equal to/greater than the `total / 2`
         2. `array1` is at most eqaul to/smaller than `total / 2`
      2. Which mean: 
         1. When we pick `0` element from `array1` for the left partition, there is alway at least `total / 2` elements in `array2` for us to pick for left partition.
         2. When we pick all elements from `array1` for the left partition, we are guarantees to pick at most `total / 2` elements, so that the size of left partition is  be `total / 2`.
4. Do binary search for the interval `[0 - array.size()]`, search for number of element we pick from `array1` as left partition.
   1. The number of the element we need to pick from `array2` for left partition of the final array will be `total / 2 - number of elements we picked`.
   2. By the way above, we can divide `array1` and `array2` in left and right partitions.
5. To be a valid partition, two conditions have to be met: (Use INT_MAX and INT_MIN to handle the case where we pick 0 element for any of the partition)
   1. The last element of left partition of array1 have to (if empty, INT_MIN) <= first element of right partition of array2 (if empty, INT_MAX)
   2. The last element of left partition of array2 have to (if empty, INT_MIN) <= first element of right partition of array1 (if empty, INT_MAX)
6. If we fail the first condition, means we have to pick fewer elements from `array1` than we previous did, do binary search for interval `[left:(mid - 1)]`
7. If we fail the second condition, do binary search for interval `[(mid + 1):right]`
8. Otherwise weâ€™ve found the right number, and cut `array1` and `array2` into left and right partitions, separately (totally 4), and return median depending on the parity of `total size`:
   1. Even number : `median = average of max(last of array1 left, last of array2 left) + min(first of array1 right, first of array2 right)`
   2. Odd number : `median = min(first of array1 right, first of array2 right)`

```c++
//Time: O(log min(size1, size2))
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        if (nums1.size() > nums2.size()) return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);
        int l = 0, r = nums1.size();
        int total = nums1.size() + nums2.size();
        while (l <= r) {
            int cut1 = l + (r - l) / 2;
            int cut2 = total / 2 - cut1;
            
            int left1 = (cut1 == 0)? INT_MIN : nums1[cut1 - 1];
            int left2 = (cut2 == 0)? INT_MIN : nums2[cut2 - 1];
            int right1 = (cut1 == nums1.size())? INT_MAX : nums1[cut1];
            int right2 = (cut2 == nums2.size())? INT_MAX : nums2[cut2];
            
            if (left1 > right2) {
                r = cut1 - 1;
            } else if (left2 > right1) {
                l = cut1 + 1;
            } else {
                if (total % 2 == 0) {
                    return (max(left1, left2) + min(right1, right2)) / 2.0;
                } else {
                    return min(right1, right2);
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
