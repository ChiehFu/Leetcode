Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.
  
Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
 

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 40
1 <= arr[i] <= 15
It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).

Thoughts:

Solution 1: Dynamic Programming (Recursion + Memorization)
1. `dp[i][j]` be the minimal cost tree of the leaf `arr[i][j]`.
2. ```
   dp[i][j] = 
   min(dp[i][k].maxLeaf * dp[k + 1][j].maxLeaf + 
       dp[i][k].sum + dp[k + 1][j].sum)
   ,where i < k < j
   ```

	```Java
	//Time: O(N^3)
	//Space: O(N^2)

	class Solution {
		private int[][][] dp;

		public int mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr) {
			int len = arr.length;
			dp = new int[len][len][2];
			
			return mctFromLeafValues(arr, 0, len - 1)[1];
		}

		public int[] mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr, int l, int r) {
			if (l == r) {
				return new int[] {arr[l], 0};
			}
			if (dp[l][r][0] != 0) {
				return dp[l][r];
			}

			dp[l][r] = new int[]{0, Integer.MAX_VALUE};
			for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {
				int[] left = mctFromLeafValues(arr, l, i);
				int[] right = mctFromLeafValues(arr, i + 1, r);
				int sum = left[0] * right[0] + left[1] + right[1];
				if (sum < dp[l][r][1]) {
					dp[l][r][1] = sum;
					dp[l][r][0] = Math.max(left[0], right[0]);
				}
			}

			return dp[l][r];
		}
	}
	```


Solution 2: Find the next Greater element on left and right
1. To build up the tree of nodes with the values of multiplication of those leaf nodes in `arr`, we need to perform exactly `arr.length - 1` times multiplication.
2. The idea is that pick the smallest leaf form the current pool and find the smallest neighbor (from both sides) that are greater than it to produce the parent and eliminate it from pool.
3. Repeat the process above until there's only one leaf left in the pool.


	```Java
	//Time: O(N)
	//Space: O(N)

	class Solution {
		public int mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr) {
			Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
			stack.add(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
			int res = 0;

			for (int a : arr) {
				while (a >= stack.peek()) {
					// for current leaf, compare the leaf on
					// right side i.e., a with the leaf on 
					// left side i.e., stack.peek()
					int current = stack.pop();
					res += current * Math.min(a, stack.peek());
				}
				stack.add(a);
			}

			while (stack.size() > 2) {
				res += stack.pop() * stack.peek();
			}

			return res;
		}
	}
	```
