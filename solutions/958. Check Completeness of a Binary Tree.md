Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1: \
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

Note:
- The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Do level order traversal to traverse the tree level by level.
2. If any level doesn't have all nodes be as far left as possible, return false.
3. If any level has the number of nodes fewer that it's suppose to have, and it's not the last level, return false.
4. Otherwise, return true.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    /**
    * Definition for a binary tree node.
    * struct TreeNode {
    *     int val;
    *     TreeNode *left;
    *     TreeNode *right;
    *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
    * };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
            if (!root) true;
            queue<TreeNode*> q;
            q.push(root);
            
            int level = 0;

            while (!q.empty()) {
                int n = q.size();
                bool end = false;
                
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                    
                    // If previous node missed any children previously and current node has any children, return false 
                    if (end && (cur->left || cur->right)) return false;
                    
                    // If current node only missed left children, return false
                    if (!cur->left && cur->right) return false;
                    // If current node miss right, or both children, raise the flag end to true
                    if (!cur->left || !cur->right) end = true;
                    
                    if (cur->left) q.push(cur->left);
                    if (cur->right) q.push(cur->right);
                }
                
                // If the level lacks any nodes and is not the last level, return false
                if (n < pow(2, level) && !q.empty()) return false;
                level++;
            }
            
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
5. A simply trick that makes the code concise and clean
    1. Push the null node into the queue as well.
    2. Once we meet a null node, break the traversal and check if there are only null nodes left in the queue, if not, return false.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)


    /**
    * Definition for a binary tree node.
    * struct TreeNode {
    *     int val;
    *     TreeNode *left;
    *     TreeNode *right;
    *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
    * };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
            if (!root) true;
            queue<TreeNode*> q;
            q.push(root);
            
            int level = 0;

            while (!q.empty()) {
                int n = q.size();
                bool end = false;
                
                while (n--) {
                    auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                    // If the current node is a nullptr, means this node should be the last node of this level and this level should be the last level of the tree
                    if (cur == nullptr) {
                        end = true;
                        break;
                    }
                    // If there is a null children, push it into the queue as well
                    q.push(cur->left);
                    q.push(cur->right);
                }
                if (end) break;
            }
            
            while (!q.empty()) {

            }
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
