Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
- If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
``` 

Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
- Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
----------

```Java
//Time: O(mlogn), m = s.length(), n = frequency of the most frequent character of t
//Space: O(26)

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class Solution {
	public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
		ArrayList<Integer>[] indiceByChar = new ArrayList[256];
		
		for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); ++i) {
			if (indiceByChar[t.charAt(i)] == null) {
				indiceByChar[t.charAt(i)] = new ArrayList<>();
			}
			indiceByChar[t.charAt(i)].add(i);
		}

		int leastNext = 0;
		for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
			if (indiceByChar[c] == null) {
				return false;
			}
			int index = Collections.binarySearch(indiceByChar[c], leastNext);
			if (index < 0) {
				index = -index - 1;
			}
			if (index == indiceByChar[c].size()) {
				return false;
			}
			leastNext = indiceByChar[c].get(index) + 1;
		}
		
		return true;
	}
}
