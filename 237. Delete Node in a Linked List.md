title: 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/237_example.png)

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Note:

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Change the value of the node pointed by the pointer directly

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        // Keep track of the original node->next
        ListNode *temp = node->next;
        // Copy the content of node->next to node (the original content of the node will be replaced)
        *node = *(node->next);
        // Delete the original node->next
        delete temp;
    }
};
```
