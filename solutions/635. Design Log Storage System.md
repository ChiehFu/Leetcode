title: 635. Design Log Storage System
tags: 
notebook: 
---

You are given several logs that each log contains a unique id and timestamp. Timestamp is a string that has the following format: `Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second`, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Design a log storage system to implement the following functions:

`void Put(int id, string timestamp):` Given a log's unique id and timestamp, store the log in your storage system.


`int[] Retrieve(String start, String end, String granularity):` Return the id of logs whose timestamps are within the range from start to end. Start and end all have the same format as timestamp. However, granularity means the time level for consideration. For example, start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59", end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59", granularity = "Day", it means that we need to find the logs within the range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017.

Example 1:
```c++
put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Year"); // return [1,2,3], because you need to return all logs within 2016 and 2017.
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Hour"); // return [1,2], because you need to return all logs start from 2016:01:01:01 to 2017:01:01:23, where log 3 is left outside the range.
```

Note:

- There will be at most 300 operations of Put or Retrieve.
- Year ranges from [2000,2017]. Hour ranges from [00,23].
- Output for Retrieve has no order required.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Store the timestamp and the index in a multimap which will sort the timestamp based on the lexicographical order :
    1. The lexicographical order of the timestamp is just same as time order represented by timestamp.
    2. There might be multiple logs having same time stamp, use multimap 
2. Use two helper strings `low = "2000:00:00:00:00:00" and high = "2017:12:31:23:59:59"` to represent the lower and upper bound of each granularity.
3. Use a hash map to keep the length of the timestamp we have to consider for each granularity.

```c++
class LogSystem {
private:
    unordered_map<string, int> m_{{"Year", 4}, {"Month", 7}, {"Day",10},
                                  {"Hour", 13}, {"Minute", 16}, {"Second", 19}};
    multimap<string, int> log_;
    string low = "2000:00:00:00:00:00";
    string high = "2017:12:31:23:59:59";
public:
    LogSystem() {
        
    }
    
    void put(int id, string timestamp) {
        log_.emplace(timestamp, id);
        // Or use log_.insert({timestamp, id}) to insert things into a multimap;        
    }
    
    vector<int> retrieve(string s, string e, string gra) {
        // Replace the low[0, l] and high[0, l] by s[0, l] and e[0, l] separately for the lower and the upper bound of the time interval, where l = the length of timestamp we need to consider for given granularity
        string l = s.substr(0, m_[gra]) + low.substr(m_[gra]);
        string h = e.substr(0, m_[gra]) + high.substr(m_[gra]);
        
        auto begin = log_.lower_bound(l);
        auto end = log_.upper_bound(h);
        vector<int> res;
        // Put every timestamp within the interval into the result vector
        for (auto it = begin; it != end; it++) {
            res.push_back(it->second);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/**
 * Your LogSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * LogSystem* obj = new LogSystem();
 * obj->put(id,timestamp);
 * vector<int> param_2 = obj->retrieve(s,e,gra);
 */
