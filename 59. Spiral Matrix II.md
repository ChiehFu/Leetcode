title: 59. Spiral Matrix II
tags: Array, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---
Given a positive integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.
```
Example:

Input: 3
Output:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Maintain four boundary variables `left, right, top and down`
2. Declare n*n array for the final result
3. Traverse the 2d array clockwisely by the following steps and fill the number:
   1. Traverse the row of top from left to right, and move the top downward by 1 (top += 1)
   2. Traverse the column of right from top to down, and move the right leftward by 1 (right -= 1)
   3. Traverse the row of down from right to left, move down upwards by 1 (down -= 1)
   4. Traverse the column of left from down to top, and move the left rightward by 1 (left += 1)
   5. Keep doing the fours step until filling all the number (use a count to keep track of the number)

```c++
//Time: O(N^2)
//Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n));
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int top = 0, down = n - 1;
        int count = 1;
        while (count <= n * n) {
            for (int j = left; j <= right; j++) {
                res[top][j] = count++;
            }
            top++;
            for (int i = top; i <= down; i++) {
                res[i][right] = count++;
            }
            right--;
            for (int j = right; j >= left; j--) {
                res[down][j] = count++;
            }
            down--;
            for (int i = down; i >= top; i--) {
                res[i][left] = count++;
            }
            left++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
