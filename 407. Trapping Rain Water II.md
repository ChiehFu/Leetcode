title: 407. Trapping Rain Water II
tags: heap, bfs, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

 

Note:

Both m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.

Example:
```
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.
```

The above image represents the elevation map [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.

After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.

----------
Thoughts:
1. We can applied the same concepts from the question [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/).
2. However, this time, our boundary is not 1D map with 2 sides (which we can keep track of by simply using two pointers), it's the positions that surround the map.
3. Use a min-heap, to pick the lowest position to send the water.
4. Each time, we send water to four directions, and we also need to keep track of the position we've visited to avoid visiting the same position.

                // If the neighbor is lower than the current water level, means it forms a container where the water can be trapped, and the amount will be the difference between the neignbor's height and the current water level
                area += max(0, cur->h - heightMap[row][col]);
                
                // If the neighbor has been filled with water, push it into the pq with a new height as current level, so that later on, this neighbor and propagate this water level to it's neighbors as well. 
                // Otherwise, push it into the pq with it's origial height.
