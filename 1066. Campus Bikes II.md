On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.

 

Example 1:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_1_v2.png)

```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
```
Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)

```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
```

Note:

- 0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000
- All worker and bike locations are distinct.
- 1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 10

Thoughts:
1. DFS + Pruning 
   1. Recursively search and backtrack to find the best combination.
      1. Apply pruning to speeding up the process. 
   ```c++
   //DFS + Pruning 
   //Time:  < O(M^N)
   //Space: O(M)

   class Solution {
   public:
       int assignBikes(vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
           if (workers.empty() || workers[0].empty()) return 0;
           vector<int> used_bike(bikes.size(), 0);

           int res = INT_MAX;
           helper(workers.size() - 1, res, 0, used_bike, workers, bikes);
           return res;
       }
       void helper(int worker_idx, int &res, int cur, vector<int> &used_bike, vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
           if (worker_idx < 0) {
               res = min(res, cur);
               return;
           }
           // Without this line of code, it will be the difference between ACCEPTED and LTE
           // Pruning
           if (cur >= res) return;
           for (int i = 0; i < bikes.size(); ++i) {
               if (used_bike[i]) continue;
               used_bike[i] = 1;
               int dis = abs(workers[worker_idx][0] - bikes[i][0]) + abs(workers[worker_idx][1] - bikes[i][1]);
               helper(worker_idx - 1, res, cur + dis, used_bike, workers, bikes);
               used_bike[i] = 0;
           }
           return;
       }
   };
   ```

2. Dynamic programming / DFS + Memorization (top-down)
    1. See each recursion as a subproblem where we find the best solution for that subproblem. 
    2. As we traversing, we might meet some subproblem solved previously, so cache those result and reuse directly.
    3. The identifiers of each subproblem are:
       1. Which worker we are allocating the bike to.
       2. Bike usage condition / how many and what bikes are available as we solved this subproblem.
    4. The first identifier can be simply represented by the worker id, however, the second one is a vector of boolean values, which used to represent if the bikes are used.
    5. Hash the boolean vector to a unique integer instead, and use it as the identifier.
       1. Use the last `10` bits of an integer to represent if `ith` bike is used.
    6. `mem[worker_id][hash of boolean vector]` will store the result of this subproblem.
    7. We can also just use a string of length `bikes.size()` to represent the state of each bike, and the string itself can be a unique key as well.
```c++
//DFS + Memorization (top-down)
//Time:   O(M*N*S), S = the number of possible states of the bike allocation (S roughly = 1<<10)
//Space:  O(M*S)

        if (workers.empty() || workers[0].empty()) return 0;
        vector<int> used_bike(bikes.size(), 0);
        mem_.assign(workers.size(), vector<int> (1<<10, -1));

        return helper(0, used_bike, workers, bikes);
    }
    int helper(int worker_idx, vector<int> &used_bike, vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
        if (worker_idx >= workers.size()) return 0;
        int h = gethash(used_bike);
        if (mem_[worker_idx][h] != -1) {
            return mem_[worker_idx][h];
        }
        
        int best = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < bikes.size(); ++i) {
            if (used_bike[i]) continue;
            used_bike[i] = 1;
            int dis = abs(workers[worker_idx][0] - bikes[i][0]) + abs(workers[worker_idx][1] - bikes[i][1]);
            best = min(best, dis + helper(worker_idx + 1, used_bike, workers, bikes));
            used_bike[i] = 0;
        }
        return mem_[worker_idx][h] = best;
    }

        int h = 0;
        for (auto n : used_bike) {
            h = h<<1;
            h |= n;
        }
        return h;
