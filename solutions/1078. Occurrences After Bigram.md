title: 1078. Occurrences After Bigram
tags: String, hash table, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given words first and second, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third", where second comes immediately after first, and third comes immediately after second.

For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the answer.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
``` 

Note:

- 1 <= text.length <= 1000
- text consists of space separated words, where each word - consists of lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10
- first and second consist of lowercase English letters.
  
----------
1. Use two hash tables to store the index where first and second word appear separately. 
2. Iterate over the index of first hash table and for each index, seach if `index + 1` is in the second hash table.
   1. If so and `index + 2` < `text.size()`, add `text[index + 2]` into the result.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findOcurrences(string text, string first, string second) {
        stringstream ss(text);
        vector<string> res;
        vector<string> index_to_word;
        unordered_map<string, unordered_set<int>> word_to_index;
        string tmp;
        int i = 0;
        while (getline(ss, tmp, ' ')) {
            word_to_index[tmp].insert(i++);
            index_to_word.push_back(tmp);
        }
        
        for (auto idx : word_to_index[first]) {
            if (word_to_index[second].find(idx + 1) != word_to_index[second].end() && 
                idx + 2 < index_to_word.size()) {
                res.push_back(index_to_word[idx + 2]);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
