Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Dynamic programming:
   1. Solve the sub-problems and use the sub-problems to solve the bigger problems
   2. `dp[i][j]` represents if `s[i, j]` is palindromic.
   3. `dp[i][j] = true` if :
      1. `s[i] == s[j] && (j - i <= 2 || dp[i+1][j-1] == true)`
         - The left and right most characters are matched 
         - There is 1 or 0 character between `i` and `j` or `s[i, j]` is also palindromic
2. Greedy
   1. Finding the longest palindrome from picking a center, keep expanding the `left` and `right` boundary of the string as long as the new left and right characters are matched
   2. Iterate through the string for each index:
      1. Pick the `index as left` and `right` of the center (one character as the center) to search for the longest `odd` length palindrome
      2. Pick the `indxe as left` and `index + 1 as right` (two characters as the center) to search for the longest `even` length palindrome

```c++
//DF
//Time: O(N^2)
//Space: O(N^2)

class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(s.size(), vector<bool>(s.size(), false));
        int start = 0;
        int length = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= j; i++) {
                dp[i][j] = ((s[i] == s[j] ) && (j - i <= 2 || (s[i] == s[j] )&& dp[i + 1][j - 1]));
                if (dp[i][j] && j - i + 1 > length) {
                    length = j - i + 1;
                    start = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return s.substr(start, length);
    }
};

```

```c++
//Greedy
//Time: <= O(N^2)(worst case)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            find(s, i, i);
            find(s, i, i + 1);
        }
        return s.substr(start_, len_);
    }
    void find(string &s, int l, int r) {
        while (l >= 0 && r < s.size() && s[l] == s[r]) {
            l--;
            r++;
        }
        if (r - l - 1 > len_) {
            len_ = r - l - 1;
            start_ = l + 1;
        }
    }
private:
    int start_ = 0;
    int len_ = 0;
};
