title: 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
tags: Tree, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---
Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

 

Example 1: \

```Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```
Example 2: \
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)


```
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
```
Example 3:\

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 4: \

```
Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
```
Note:

1<= N <= 100
0 <= node.val <= N

----------
Thoughts:
1. This question can't be solved by treating the tree as a graph and simply do BFS search the node have more that 1 coin for those nodes have no coin, it's not guaranteed to be optimal (can get answer greater than 4 if we pick wrong node to support coin for the nodes that need)
```
     0
    / \
   2   3
  /   / \
 0   0   0
          \
           2
```
2. Use the flow concept for this question:
    1. If a leaf is `0`, means it needs a coin passed from it's parent, so the edge between them will be `-1` to represent one coin has to pass from the parent to the node, return -1
    2. If a leaf it greater than `1`, say `n`, means other `n - 1` coins will need to be passed through its parent to support for other, so the edge will have a positive flow `n - 1`, return `n - 1`
    3. If a leaf is `1`, there will be no flow for the edge between, so return `0` 
    4. The parent node count the net flow of two flows from children and -1 if it needs a coin, and pass the final net flow to its parent.
    5. The total coin move will be the sum of the absolute value of the ent flows on each edge, since require and send will all need a move
