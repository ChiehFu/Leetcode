title: 845. Longest Mountain in Array
tags: Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming
notebook: Leetcode
---

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

 - B.length >= 3
 - There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]
(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain. 

Return 0 if there is no mountain.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```
Note:

- 0 <= A.length <= 10000
- 0 <= A[i] <= 10000
Follow up:

- Can you solve it using only one pass?
- Can you solve it in O(1) space?

----------
Thoughts:

**Two pass with O(N) space:**

1. Scan twice to build two vectors `up[i], down[i]`, such that `up[i]` is the longest increasing sequence starting from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, and `down[i]` is the longest decreasing sequence starting from `i - 1` to `0`.
2. For `i`, if `up[i] > 0 && down[i] > 0`, the length of the mountain with peak `i` will be `up[i] + down[i] + 1`
    ```c++
    //Two pass with O(N) space
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestMountain(vector<int>& A) {
            if (A.size() < 3) return 0;
            vector<int> down(A.size(), 0), up(A.size(), 0);
            int lma = 0;
            
            for (int i = A.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (A[i] > A[i + 1]) down[i] = down[i + 1] + 1;
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < A.size() - 1; i++) {
                if (i > 0 && A[i] > A[i - 1]) up[i] = up[i - 1] + 1;
                if (down[i] > 0 && up[i] > 0) lma = max(lma, down[i] + up[i] + 1);
            }
            
            return lma;
        }
    };
    ```

**One pass with O(1) space:**
1. Iterate over the array and sequentially do the following 4 processes to find the longest mountain:
   1. Jump over the non-increasing/non-decreasing sequence
   2. Find the increasing sequence
   3. Find the decreasing sequence
   4. If there are contiguous increasing and decreasing sequences `(at least with length of 1)`, we've found a mountain, update the longest mountain.
   
    ```c++
    //One pass with O(1) space
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestMountain(vector<int>& A) {
            if (A.size() < 3) return 0;
            
            int ans = 0;
            int i = 0;
            
            while (i < A.size() - 1) {
                
                // Jump over the non-increase/non-decrease sequence
                while (i < A.size() - 1 && A[i] == A[i + 1]) i++;
                
                int inc = 0, dec = 0;
                //Find increase sequence
                while (i < A.size() - 1 && A[i] < A[i + 1]) {
                    i++;
                    inc++;
                }
                
                //Find decrease sequence
                while (i < A.size() - 1 && A[i] > A[i + 1]) {
                    i++;
                    dec++;
                }
                
                if (inc > 0 && dec > 0) ans = max(ans, inc + dec + 1);
            }
            
            return ans;
        }
    };
