title: 996. Number of Squareful Arrays

notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,17,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 1
 
```
Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 12
- 0 <= A[i] <= 1e9

----------
Thoughts:
1. Graph + DFS + back tracking (find the selectable value for each value first)
   1. For each different value that shows in the input array
      1. Count it's frequency 
      2. Build a graph where each node represents a value and the neighbors of the node will be the value with which can sum to a square value (include the node itself).
   2. Do dfs from each node(value) in the graph and update the number of each value that can be used when we pick anyone.
      1. Even there is a path from a to b, we can't not pick b if b's count is 0.
   3. 3. Add the numebr of permutations by one once we successfully pick all available values
   
2. DFS + back tracking (find the selectable value during the dfs process and avoid duplicates)
   1. Sort the input value so that duplicates will be adjacent to one and another and we can avoid duplicates by not picking the same value when back tracking.
   2. In each recursion, iterate through all values and find the valid (non duplicate) neighbors that hasn't been picked, pick it and go into next recursion.
   3. Add the numebr of permutations by one once we successfully pick all available values
