In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

Note:

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are english lowercase letters.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the `order`, and map the characters to their index in `order` to represent their related order.
2. Based on the related order table, check the `words` array to see if there are any two consecutive strings breach the order.

```c++
//Time:  O(NS), N = words.size(), S = avg({word}), for word in words.
//Space: O(26) -> O(1)

// Call the function is_sorted(), with self-defined comparator
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        vector<int> orders(26);
        for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
            orders[order[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        return is_sorted(words.begin(), words.end(), [&orders] (const string &a, const string &b) {
            int i = 0;
            while (i < a.size() && i < b.size()) {
                if (a[i] != b[i]) {
                    return orders[a[i] - 'a'] < orders[b[i] - 'a'];
                }
                i++;
            }
            return a.size() < b.size();
        });
    }

};

// Implement function to check if given two consecutive strings is in the correct order
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        vector<int> orders(26);
        for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
            orders[order[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        // Compare every two consecutive strings to make sure they are in ordered
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (!is_smaller(words[i], words[i + 1], orders)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    bool is_smaller(string &a, string& b, vector<int> &orders) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < a.size() && i < b.size()) {
            if (a[i] != b[i]) {
                if (orders[a[i] - 'a'] < orders[b[i] - 'a']) return true;
                else return false;
            }
            i++;
        }
        if (i == a.size()) return true;
        else return false;
    }
};
```
