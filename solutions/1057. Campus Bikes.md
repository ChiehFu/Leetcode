On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the i-th worker is assigned to.

 

Example 1:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_1_v2.png)
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
```

Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation: 
Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].
```

Note:

- 0 <= workers[i][j], bikes[i][j] < 1000
- All worker and bike locations are distinct.
- 1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 1000

----------
Thoughts:
1. Calculate the distance between each worker and each bike.
2. Sort the possible combinations based on three properties with the precedence.
   1. The distance of this combination.
   2. The index of the workers.
   3. The index of the bikes.
3. Greedily allocate/pick the pair the bike based on the distance between workers and bikes.
4. In the mean time, keep track of the used bikes and picked workers so that we can omit the combination that comes up later and contains the used bike and picked worker.
5. How to sort?
   1. Normal sorting/Priority queue which takes `O(MNlogMN)` time, where `M = # of workers`, `N = # of bikes` and `O(MN)` space.
   2. Given the range of the distance is within a range, we can use bucket sort for the sorting, which takes `O(MN)` time and `O(L^2)` space.

    ```c++
    //Bucket sort
    //Time:  O(MN)
    //Space: O(MN)

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> assignBikes(vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
            vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> bucket(2000);
            vector<int> used_bike(bikes.size(), 0);
            
            for (int i = 0; i < workers.size(); ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < bikes.size(); ++j) {
                    int dis = abs(workers[i][0] - bikes[j][0]) + abs(workers[i][1] - bikes[j][1]);
                    bucket[dis].push_back({i, j});
                }
            }
            vector<int> res(workers.size(), -1);
            for (int i = 0, remain = workers.size(); i < bucket.size() && remain; ++i) {

                    res[bucket[i][j].first] = bucket[i][j].second;
                    used_bike[bucket[i][j].second] = 1;
                    if (--remain == 0) break;
                }
