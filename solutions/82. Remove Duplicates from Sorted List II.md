title: 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
tags: Linked List, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5
Output: 1->2->5
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 1->1->1->2->3
Output: 2->3
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use an additional dummy node to handle the case where we have to remove the first node more consistently.
2. Use `cur` starting from `dummy` to traverse the linked list.
   1. If `cur->next->val == cur->next->next->val`, find and remove all the nodes having same value after `cur`, and link `cur` to the node (could be a NULL) next to the last node having same value.
   2. Otherwise, move forward the `cur` pointer.
3. In c++, we have to delete the node to release the memory manually.


```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        auto dummy = new ListNode(0), cur = dummy;
        dummy->next = head;
        while (cur->next && cur->next->next) {
            if (cur->next->val != cur->next->next->val) {
                cur = cur->next;
            } else {
                auto tmp = cur->next;
                // Find the last node having same value
                while (tmp->next && tmp->val == tmp->next->val) {
                    auto next = tmp->next;
                    delete tmp;
                    tmp = next;
                }
                // Link cur to the node next to the last node
                cur->next = tmp->next;
                
                // Delete the last node
                delete tmp;
            }
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
