title: 767. Reorganize String
tags: heap, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string S, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.

If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty string.

Example 1:
```
Input: S = "aab"
Output: "aba"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: S = "aaab"
Output: ""
```
Note:

- S will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range [1, 500].
----------
Thoughts:
1. Count the frequency of each character of the string 
2. Rebuild a string where there is no identical characters adjacent to each other.
   1. Greedily pick the most frequent char first, and the character won't be considered again until the next character has been picked.
   2. Use max-heap to efficiently get most frequent char, and push the selected character along with the updated frequency back to the heap after the next character has been picked in the next iteration.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(NlogN)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        string reorganizeString(string S) {
            vector<int> freq(26, 0);
            // Count the frequency for each character
            for (auto c : S) freq[c - 'a']++;
            // Comparator of a max-heap based on characters' frequency
            auto cmp = [&freq] (int a, int b) {
                return freq[a] < freq[b];
            };
            
            priority_queue<int, vector<int>, decltype(cmp)> pq(cmp);
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (freq[i] != 0) pq.push(i);
            }
            
            // Write the new answer to original string S with a writing index
            int w_idx = 0;
            int last = -1;
            while (!pq.empty()) {
                // Pick the top character and rewrite the string 
                int pick = pq.top(); pq.pop();
                S[w_idx++] = pick + 'a';
                
                // If there is a previously picked character, and it's remaining frequency is at least 1, push it back
                if (last != -1) {
                    if (--freq[last] > 0) pq.push(last);
                }
                // Store the character picked this iteration, and push it back with the new frequency after in iteration, to make it to be considered for another position again
                last = pick;
            }
            // Check if we successfully re build the whole string 
            return w_idx == S.size()? S : "";
