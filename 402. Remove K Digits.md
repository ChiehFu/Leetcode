title: 402. Remove K Digits
tags: Stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:
```c++
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. For a set of Digits, the smallest number they can make up will be a number having all digit sorted in ascending order. e.g., `123456`
2. Here we can compare the char of digits directly, as their relative order is same as the one between integer digits.
3. For a given number, to find the smallest number by removing `k` digits, we need to work form the most significant digits, and try remove the `k` digits such that in the final numbers, there are as many digits sorted in ascending order as possible, this way, this will be the smallest possible number.
4. Scan from left to right of the string, if there is a digit `num[i]` such that `num[i] < num[i - 1]`, we can remove the digit `num[i - 1]`.
5. Use a stack to keep track of the pervious digits and pop them out if needs.
6. Handle the following cases 
   1. `k == nums.size()`
      1. Remove all digits, return `"0"` directly.
   2. We have made the digits of the number all in ascending order, and we still have to remove `n` digits
      1. Remove `n` digit from the back of the numebrs
   3. Trailing zeroes

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
        // We can handle the case where k == nums.size() directly
        if (k == num.size()) return "0";
        stack<char> s;
        // Use a stack to store every digit of the number
        for (int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++) {
            // If k > 0
            // As we meet a digit having the value is smaller than the one on the top of the stack for previous digit, we remove the one on the top of the stack, to make as many digits in ascending order as possible
            while (k > 0 && !s.empty() && num[i] < s.top()) {
                s.pop();
                k--;
            }
            s.push(num[i]);
        }
        // If the digits of the number are already ascending, but k still > 0, we remove k digits from the back of the number, i.e., directly pop out from the stack.
        while (k-- > 0) s.pop();
        
        string res = "";
        while (!s.empty()) {
            res += s.top();
            s.pop();
        }  
        // Pop out the trailing 0 back, as the number is reversed
        while (res.size() > 1 && res.back() == '0') res.pop_back();
        reverse(begin(res), end(res));
        return res;
    }
};
```
