Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

Example 1:
```
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```
Example 5:
```
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
```
Example 6:
```
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Extract the directories separated by the slash signs, and store in a stack.
2. When we meet `..`, pop out one directory from the stack if exists.
3. Use the directories in the stack to form a canonical path with slash inserted between properly.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string> dirs;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < path.size()) {
            // Extract the directory or ".."/"." separated by slash signs
            if (i < path.size() && path[i] == '/') {
                i++;
            } else {
                int j = i;
                while (i < path.size() && path[i] != '/') i++;
                string dir = path.substr(j, i - j);
                if (dir == "..") {
                    if (!dirs.empty()) dirs.pop();
                } else if (dir != ".") dirs.push(dir);
            }
        }
        string res = "";
        while (!dirs.empty()) {
            // The dirs popped out from the stack are in reversed order, so every time, append the current path to the new directory. 
            res = "/" + dirs.top() + res;
            dirs.pop();
        }
        
        // For corner cases where path = "", return "/"
        return (res == "")? "/":res;
    }
};
```
