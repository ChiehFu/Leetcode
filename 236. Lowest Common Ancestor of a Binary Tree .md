Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

Thoughts:
1. The target nodes are guaranteed to exist
1. Do DFS to visit each node
2. If current node match one of the target, return it directly and by doing so can cover two possible cases:
   - Another target node is in it' subtree, then current will be the lowest ancestor
   - Another target is not in the subtree, return the one we found so that if there is a node in upper level get two returned nodes from it's subtree, we'll know that node will be the ancestor.
3. If the target nodes are not alway existed, we have to return the number of node we found from each level, so that the node having totally 2 nodes found in it's subtree and it will be the ancestor

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;
        if (root == p || root == q) return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if (left && right) return root;
        else return (left != nullptr)? left : right;
    }

};
