title: 835. Image Overlap
tags: Array, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

Example 1:
```
Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
```

Notes: 

- `1 <= A.length = A[0].length = B.length = B[0].length <= 30`
- `0 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1`

----------
Thoughts:
1. Because we can move one image arbitrarily in four directions, every `1` in image `A` and `B` could overlaps with one another with some `offset` on x-axis and y-axis.
2. The idea is that, of all the possible `offset`, the one that causes most `1` in both images to overlap with one another will be the one we're looking for.
3. Get the sets coordinations of `1` in image `A` and image `B`, for each coordination in two sets, calculate the `offset` and count the number of them.
4. Return the count of the maximal `offset`.
