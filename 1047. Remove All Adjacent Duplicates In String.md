title: 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
tags: String, Stack, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

Note:

- 1 <= S.length <= 20000
- S consists only of English lowercase letters.

Thoughts:
1. Ordinary stack solution
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        string removeDuplicates(string S) {
            stack<char> stk;
            for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); ++i) {
                if (!stk.empty() && stk.top() == S[i]) {
                    stk.pop();
                } else {
                    stk.push(S[i]);
                }
            }
            string res = "";
            while (!stk.empty()) {
                res += stk.top();
                stk.pop();
            }
            reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Based on the first solution, further optimize to use constant space
   1. Use the original string as a container for a stack, use a variable `top` to keep track of the index of the character on top of the stack.
   2. When we want to pop out the character on `top`, just reduce the `top` by 1, when we want to add character into the stack, increase `top` by 1, and overwrite the character at `top` to the character we want to write.
   3. Return the substring of the index from `[0 - top]`

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        string removeDuplicates(string S) {
            int top = -1;
            for (auto &c : S) {
                if (top == -1 || S[top] != c) {
                    S[++top] = c;
                } else {
                    --top;
                }
            }
            return S.substr(0, top + 1);
        }
    };
    ```
