Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```
Note:

- The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

----------
1. Use the counter technique used in the question [136. Single Number.md](https://github.com/ChiehFu/leetcode/tree/master/solutions/136.%20Single%20Number.md).
2. In this case, the result we got from the counter will be the XOR of two numbers that occurrence once. 
3. How do we get the two desired numbers out of this XOR result? 
   1. Look at the XOR value, any bit of `1s` actually means where the two desired values differ from each other.
   2. By knowing where these two desired values differ from each other, we can divide the original array into two groups based on the value of that bit, which will guarantee that these two values will be put into different groups.
   3. Run the counting algorithm for two groups separately again, and return the result of each groups.
   
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int c0 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            c0 ^= num;
        }
        
        int lastDiffBit = 1;
        while ((lastDiffBit & c0) == 0) {
            lastDiffBit <<= 1;
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[] {0, 0};
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((num & lastDiffBit) == 0) {
                result[0] ^= num;
            } else {
                result[1] ^= num;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
