notebook: Leetcode

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Define the question in a general form - `Given an array of numbers, all numbers show exact k times except for one number that only shows p times, find that number in linear time`.
2. See each number as it's binary representation form.
3. Design a counter mechanism and use `m counters, m >= logk` to do a bit-wise counting for every bit for every number.
4. When any given bit is counted for k times, reset the counter of that bit.
5. In the end, the counter will record only the bits of the number that shows p times in the array.
6. In this question, `k = 2`, so the counter of the bit will automatically reset to `0` once `2` is hit.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int c0 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            c0 = c0 ^ nums[i];
        }
        return c0;
    }
}
```
