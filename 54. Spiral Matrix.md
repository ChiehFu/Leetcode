title: 54. Spiral Matrix
tags: Array, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
```
Example 1:

Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```
```
Example 2:

Input:
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Maintain four boundary variables `left, right, top and down`
2. To get a clockwise order, traverse the 2d array in the following steps:
   1. Traverse the row of top from left to right, and move the top downward by 1 (top += 1)
   2. Traverse the column of right from top to down, and move the right leftward by 1 (right -= 1)
   3. Traverse the row of down from right to left, move down upwards by 1 (down -= 1)
   4. Traverse the column of left from down to top, and move the left rightward by 1 (left += 1)
   5. Keep doing the fours step until visiting all the position (use a count to keep track of the number of the positions we've visited)

```c++
//Time: O(N^2)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty()) return {};
        
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<int> result;

        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int up = 0, down = m - 1;
        
        while (result.size() < m * n) {
            for (int j = left; j <= right && result.size() < m * n; j++) {
                result.push_back(matrix[up][j]);
            }
            up++;
            for (int i = up; i <= down && result.size() < m * n; i++) {
                result.push_back(matrix[i][right]);
            }
            right--;
            for (int j = right; j >= left && result.size() < m * n; j--) {
                result.push_back(matrix[down][j]);
            }
            down--;
            for (int i = down; i >= up && result.size() < m * n; i--) {
                result.push_back(matrix[i][left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
