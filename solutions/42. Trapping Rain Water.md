Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:
```c++
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

----------
Thoughts:

Here is my idea: instead of calculating area by height*width, we can think it in a cumulative way. In other words, sum water amount of each bin(width=1).
Search from left to right and maintain a max height of left and right separately, which is like a one-side wall of partial container. Fix the higher one and flow water from the lower part. For example, if current height of left is lower, we fill water in the left bin. Until left meets right, we filled the whole container.

3 Solutions:
1. Dynamic Programming
    - Think of the trapping water of each bin is determined by the walls on two sides, scan from left to right to find the left highest wall for each bin. 
    - Scan from right to left to search for the right highest wall for each bin, calculate the area for each bin by `min(left, right) - bottom`.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int trap(vector<int>& height) {
            vector<int> left(height.size(), 0);
            int cur = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < left.size(); i++) {
                cur = max(cur, height[i]);
                left[i] = cur;
            }
            cur = 0;
            int area = 0;
            for (int i = left.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                cur = max(cur, height[i]);
                area += min(cur, left[i]) - height[i];
            }
            
            return area;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Two Pointers
    - See each index as a bucket and the trapping water of the bucket is formed by it’s two sides, and determined by the shorter side.
    - Use left and right pointer to search the longer and shorter side, move the shorter side to the next position, if next position is lower than previous max height, means we’ve found a bottom, calculate it’s trapping water by `shorter side - bottom`. 
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int trap(vector<int>& height) {
            int l = 0, r = height.size() - 1;
            int lMax = 0, rMax = 0;
            int area = 0;
            
            while (l < r) {
                if (height[l] < height[r]) {
                    lMax = max(lMax, height[l]);
                    area += lMax - height[l];
                    l++;
                } else {
                    rMax = max(rMax, height[r]);
                    area += rMax - height[r];
                    r--;
                }
            }
            
            return area;
        }
    };
    ```
3. Stack
    - Push the height with index into the stack as long as the current height is shorter  than the last in the stack. 
    - When current height higher than the last in the stack, means current will be a right boundary and stack.top() will be the middle, and we pop out the values from stack until stack.top() > middle, and stack.top() will be the left side, calculate the area by `(min(left, right) - middle) * (right_index - left_index - 1)`.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int trap(vector<int>& height) {
            stack<pair<int, int>> s;
            int area = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < height.size(); i++) {
                while (!s.empty() && height[i] > s.top().first) {
                    int bot = s.top().first;
                    while (!s.empty() && s.top().first <= bot) {
                        s.pop();
                    }
                    if (!s.empty()) {
                        area += (min(s.top().first, height[i]) - bot) * (i - s.top().second - 1);
                    }
                }
                s.push({height[i], i});
            }
            
            return area;
        }
    };
    ```
