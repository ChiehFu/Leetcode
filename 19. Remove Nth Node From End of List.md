title: 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:
```c++
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

Note:
- Given n will always be valid.

Follow up:
- Could you do this in one pass?
----------
Thoughts:
1. Two pass:
    1. Count the size of the list and figure out the position of the target node counted from the head of the list.
    2. Say the node is `kth` node from the head of the list, we move to `k-1th` node, and remove `kth` node.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)
    
    /**
    * Definition for singly-linked list.
    * struct ListNode {
    *     int val;
    *     ListNode *next;
    *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
    * };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
            ListNode *cur = head;
            int c = 0;
            while (cur) {
                c += 1;
                cur = cur->next;
            }
            c -= n;
            
            ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0);
            dummy->next = head;
            cur = dummy;
            
            while (c--) cur = cur->next;
            
            ListNode *tmp = cur->next;
            cur->next = tmp->next;
            
            delete tmp;
            tmp = nullptr;
            
            return dummy->next;
        }
    };
    ```
2. One pass:
    1. Use two pointers `slow, fast`, make the distance between them `n`
    2. Move the two pointers forward simultaneously, when the fast pointer reach the last node `lth`, the slow pointer will be at `(l - n)th`, and `(l - n + 1)th` will be exactly the node we want to remove.
    3. Use a dummy node to handle the case where we need to remove the head of the list and keep the code consistent.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    /**
    * Definition for singly-linked list.
    * struct ListNode {
    *     int val;
    *     ListNode *next;
    *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
    * };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
            ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0);
            dummy->next = head;
            ListNode *slow = dummy, *fast = dummy;
            while (n--) fast = fast->next;
            
            while (fast->next) {
                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next;
            }
            slow->next = slow->next->next;
            return dummy->next;
        }
    };

    /*
    n = 2
    dummy->1->2->3->4->5
    */
    ```
