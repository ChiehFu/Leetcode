Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

Note:

We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seems to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

----------
- Mutex are used for mutual exclusion i.e to safe gaurd the critical sections of a code.
- Semaphone/condition_variable are used for thread synchronisation(which is what we want to achieve here).
- Mutex have ownership assigned with them, that is to say, the thread that locks a mutex must only unlock it. Also, we must not unlock a mutex that has not been locked (This is what most programs have got wrong).
- If the mutex is not used as said above, the behavior is undefined, which however in our case produces the required result.


    ```c++
    class Foo {
    public:
        Foo() {
            
        }

        void first(function<void()> printFirst) {
            unique_lock<mutex> lck(mtx);
            // printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
            printFirst();
            count = 2;
            cv.notify_all();
        }

        void second(function<void()> printSecond) {
            unique_lock<mutex> lck(mtx);
            while (count != 2) {
                cv.wait(lck);
            }
            // printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.count
            printSecond();
            count = 3;
            cv.notify_all();
        }

        void third(function<void()> printThird) {
            unique_lock<mutex> lck(mtx);
            while (count != 3) {
                cv.wait(lck);
            }
            // printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
            printThird();
        }
    private:
        mutex mtx;
        condition_variable cv;
        int count = 0;
    };
    ```
