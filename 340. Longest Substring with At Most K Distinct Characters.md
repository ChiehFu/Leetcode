---

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
```
Example 2:

```c++
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Two Pointers with Sliding Window.
   1. Keep track of the number of characters in current substring.
   2. Expand the window to find the longest substring.
   3. Shrink the window form left side if there are more than k distinct characters.


```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> m(128, 0);
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            if (m[s[j]]++ == 0) k--;
            while (k < 0) {
                if (m[s[i++]]-- == 1) k++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
