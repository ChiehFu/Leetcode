Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:
Given tree s:
```
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
 ```
Given tree t:
```
   4 
  / \
 1   2
```
Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
Example 2:
Given tree s:
```
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
```
Given tree t:
```
   4
  / \
 1   2
```
Return false.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Recursively traverse the original tree, if the current node's value same the root of the targeted tree, call a comparing function to compare the subtree from this node to the target subtree. 
2. Recursively traversal two tree at the same time and compare the value, return true only if there are all matched in terms of values and tree structure

```c++
Time: O(N ^ 2), we can possibly start comparing to the subtree from any nodes in the original tree as long as their values match.

Space: O(logN)

 *     int val;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubtree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
        if (!s) return false;
        if (s->val == t->val) {
            if (compareTrees(s, t)) return true;
        }
        return isSubtree(s->left, t) || isSubtree(s->right, t);
    }
    bool compareTrees(TreeNode* node1, TreeNode* node2) {
        if (!node1 ^ !node2) return false;
        if (!node1 && !node2) return true;
        return node1->val == node2->val && compareTrees(node1->left, node2->left) && compareTrees(node1->right, node2->right);
    }
