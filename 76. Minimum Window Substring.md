title: 76. Minimum Window Substring

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:
```c++
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```
Note:

- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window of substring.
2. Expand the right side of the window gradually, each time:
    1. If the current window contain all characters in `t`, update the best answer.
    2. Greedily shrink the window from the left side to find the shortest valid window until the window doesn't contain all characters in `t` anymore.
    
```c++
//Time:  O(M + N)
//Space: O(128)

class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> m(128, 0);
        // How many distinct characters in t
        int needs = 0;
        int start = 0, len = s.size() + 1;
        
        // Store the number of character required in a hashmap
        for (char c : t) {
            if (m[c]++ == 0) needs++;
        }
        
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < s.size()) {
            // Extend the window by 1 and see if we meet the character we need 
            if (m[s[r++]]-- == 1) needs--;

            // If the current window contain all characters in t, update the best length of the window and try to shrink the window from left side until the window doesn't satisfy the requirement anymore.
            while (l < r && needs == 0) {

                if (r - l < len) {
                    start = l;
                    len = r - l;
                }

                // If we just remove the character we need, increase needs by 1
                if (m[s[l]]++ == 0) {
                    needs++;
                }
                l++;
            }
        }
        
        return (len == s.size() + 1)? "" : s.substr(start, len);
    }
};
