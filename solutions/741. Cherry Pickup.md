title: 741. Cherry Pickup

notebook: Leetcode
---

In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

 

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
 

Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:

 

- Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(N-1, N-1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
- After reaching `(N-1, N-1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells;
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
- If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(N-1, N-1)`, then no cherries can be collected.
 

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid =
[[0, 1, -1],
 [1, 0, -1],
 [1, 1,  1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
 ```

Note:

- grid is an N by N 2D array, with 1 <= N <= 50.
- Each grid[i][j] is an integer in the set {-1, 0, 1}.
- It is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.
