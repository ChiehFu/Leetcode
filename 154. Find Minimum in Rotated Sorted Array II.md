title: 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
tags: Binary Search, Array, hard, Divide and conquer
notebook: Leetcode
---

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

Note:

- This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
----------
Thoughts:
1. Two solutions similar to the question [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array)
2. The special case like `[1,1,1,1,2,1,1]` needs to be handled
   1. When `nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right]` 
      1. Increase left and decrease right by 1 to shrink the array
      2. The solution above will return us a right minimum value, however the one it return is not at the correct index i.e., `5` in this case, because value at index `5` might be removed during the process above, to avoid that, add the judgement before increase and decrease left and right:
        ```c++
            // For the case like [1,1,1,2,1], index 4 is the correct position of the minimal value, before decrease it, check if it's the first element of the right part to avoid passed the right index:
            // if it's return set left to right and break
            if (nums[right - 1] > nums[right]) {
                left = right;
                break;
            } else {
                l++;
                r--;
            }
        ```
```c++
//Time: O(logN) - O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return INT_MAX;
        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            if (nums[l] < nums[r]) return nums[l];
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (nums[l] == nums[m] && nums[m] == nums[r]) {
                // Check if right is the index of the minimum value, if it's set left to right and break
                if (nums[r - 1] > nums[r]) {
                    l = r;
                    break;
                }
                l++;
                r--;
            } else if (nums[l] <= nums[m]) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else { 
                r = m;
                // We know that nums[m] < nums[l], which means nums[l] can't be the answer, we can increase it right here
                l++;
            }
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
};
