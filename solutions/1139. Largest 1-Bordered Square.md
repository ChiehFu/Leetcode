Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the grid.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 9
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= grid.length <= 100
- 1 <= grid[0].length <= 100
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

----------
Thoughts:
1. For each cell `grid[i][j] == 1`, get it's number of consecutive `1s` on the left and top (including itself) represented as `left[i][j], top[i][j]`, which can be derived from `left[i][j - 1]` and `top[i - 1][j]` (Dynamic Programming).
2. At each cell `grid[i][j]`, search the 1-bordered square of length starting from `min(left[i][j], top[i][j])` till the length is shorter that the one found previously (then early stop the process), during the process, record the longest length of 1-bordered square.


```Java
// Time : O(n^3) 
// Space : O(n^2)

class Solution {
    public int largest1BorderedSquare(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] left = new int[m][n], top = new int[m][n];
        int len = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    left[i][j] = j > 0 ? left[i][j - 1] + 1 : 1;
                    top[i][j] = i > 0  ? top[i - 1][j] + 1 : 1;
                    
                    for (int l = Math.min(left[i][j], top[i][j]); l > len; --l) {
                        // A 1-boarded square of length l can be formed if 
                        // left[i - l + 1][j] >= l and 
                        // top[i][j - l + 1] >= l
                        if (left[i - l + 1][j] >= l && top[i][j - l + 1] >= l) {
                            len = l;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return len * len;
    }
}
