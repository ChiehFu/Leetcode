title: 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
tags: Tree
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [3,2,1]
```
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

----------
Thoughts:
1. For iterative solutions:
2. Do pre-order traversal (go right first), reverse the result = post-order traversal
3. Double pushing (see the code comment)

```c++
//Time: O(N), N = number of nodes 
//Space: O(N)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return {};
        vector<int> result;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        
        // Push the node twice, when it's the first it got popped from the stack, go add it's children
        // Otherwise, visit it
        s.push(root);
        s.push(root);
        
        while (!s.empty()) {
            auto cur = s.top();
            s.pop();
            
            // For the first time pop-out, add it's children into the stack from right to left(so that can be popped form left to right)
            if (!s.empty() && cur == s.top()) {
                if (cur->right) {
                    s.push(cur->right);
                    s.push(cur->right);
                }
                if (cur->left) {
                    s.push(cur->left);
                    s.push(cur->left);
                }
            } else { //For the second time, all it's descendants have been visited and popped out, visit it this time  
                result.push_back(cur->val);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
