title: 636. Exclusive Time of Functions
tags: Stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between 0 and N-1.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format: "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}".  For example, "0:start:3" means the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3.  "1:end:2" means the function with id 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2.

A function's exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does not include any recursive calls to child functions.

The CPU is single threaded which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
```

Note:

- 1 <= n <= 100
- Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
- Functions will always log when they exit.

Thoughts:
1. Use two variable `pre_id, pre_time` (initialize as `-1, -1`) to keep track of previous task id and it's starting time
1. If we want to start a new process `B`, 
   1. First we check if there is a previous process `pre_id = A` running.
   2. If so, we first calculation the executing time for `A` which is `B.start - pre_time`, and store it in the executing time table by task id `pre_id = A`.
   3. Because `A` hasn't finished yet, we push `A` into a stack, and switch to running `B`, so set `pre_id = B`, `pre_time = B.start`. 
   4. When `B` is finished at some point, 
      1. First, we calculate the executing time for `B` by time = `B.end - pre.start + 1`
      2. We recover `A` from the stack, `pre_id = A`, and assign it with a new starting time `pre.start = B.end + 1`.
         1. If there is no task in the stack, we set `pre_id, pre.start` to `-1, -1`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        int pre_id = -1;
        int pre_time = -1;
        vector<int> exe_time(n, 0);
        stack<int> stack;
        
        for (auto &log : logs) {
            int i = log.find_first_of(':');
            int j = log.find_last_of(':');
            
            int id = stoi(log.substr(0, i));
            bool is_start = (log.substr(i + 1, j - i - 1) == "start");
            int time = stoi(log.substr(j + 1));
            
            if (is_start) {
                // When a new task is coming
                // If there is a previous task running 
                if (pre_id != -1) {
                    // Calculate the exe time for it from it's start till now
                    exe_time[pre_id] += time - pre_time;
                    // Push the task into a stack
                    stack.push(pre_id);
                }

                // Set the pre_id and pre_time to current task
                pre_id = id;
                pre_time = time;
            } else {
                // When a task is ending
                // Calculate it executing time   
                exe_time[id] += time - pre_time + 1;

                // If there is a previous task in the stack
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    // Recover the task and assign it a new starting time, which is current time + 1
                    pre_id = stack.top(); stack.pop();
                    pre_time = time + 1;
                } else {

                    // If there is no previous task, reset pre_id, pre_time to -1
                    pre_id = -1;
                    pre_time = -1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return exe_time;
    }
