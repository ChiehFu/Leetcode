notebook: Leetcode

A string S represents a list of words.

Each letter in the word has 1 or more options.  If there is one option, the letter is represented as is.  If there is more than one option, then curly braces delimit the options.  For example, "{a,b,c}" represents options ["a", "b", "c"].

For example, "{a,b,c}d{e,f}" represents the list ["ade", "adf", "bde", "bdf", "cde", "cdf"].

Return all words that can be formed in this manner, in lexicographical order.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: "{a,b}c{d,e}f"
Output: ["acdf","acef","bcdf","bcef"]
Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ["abcd"]
``` 

Note:

- 1 <= S.length <= 50
- There are no nested curly brackets.
- All characters inside a pair of consecutive opening and ending curly brackets are different.


----------
1. Permutation problem, solve with Back Tracking or an iterative solution.

```c++
//Time:  O(ML), M = total number of permutation, L = length of the permutation word
//Space: O(ML)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> expand(string S) {
        if (S.empty()) return {};
        vector<string> res = {""};
        
        for (int i = S.size() - 1; i >= 0;) {
            vector<string> tmp;
            if (S[i] == '}') {
                int j = i;
                while (i >= 0 && S[i] != '{') --i;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k += 2) {
                    for (auto &sub : res) {
                        tmp.push_back(S[k] + sub);
                    }
                }
            } else {
                for (auto &sub : res) {
                    tmp.push_back(S[i] + sub);
                }
            }
            --i;
            swap(tmp, res);
        }
        sort(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```
