title: 450. Delete Node in a BST
tags: Tree,Binary Search,medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:
```
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Do binary search for the target node
2. Delete the node based on following conditinos:
   1. target node has no children 
   2. has one child
   3. has two children 

```c++
Time: O(tree height)
Space: O(tree height)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

        if (!root) return nullptr;
        
        // In first two condition, we do bunary search for the target node
        // Third condition to handle the node deletion
        if (key < root->val) {
            root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
        } else if (key > root->val) {
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
        } else {
            // For the cases of 1 or 0 children
            if (!root->left || !root->right) {
                TreeNode* tmp = root;

                tmp = nullptr;
            } else { // For the case of two children 
                // Steps:
                // 1. Find the biggest node in the left subtree (the predecessor of the current node in in-order)
                // 2. Replace the current's value by it's predecessor's (like swapping two nodes)
                // 3. Delete that predecessor
                
                // 1. Find biggest node of left subtree to swap with root
                TreeNode* cur = root->left;
                while (cur->right) cur = cur->right;
                
                // 2. Set the value of the root to be that swapped node 
                root->val = cur->val;
                
                // 3. Call deleteNode to delete that swapped node from left subtree
                root->left = deleteNode(root->left, cur->val);
            }
        }
        return root;
