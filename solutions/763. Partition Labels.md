A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```
Note:

- S will have length in range [1, 500].
- S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

Thoughts:
1. Two pointers
    1. Store the last index of each character of the string.
    2. Maintain a `start` and a `last` pointer for the current substring
    3. Iterate over the characters in the string and each time add a character `S[i]` into the substring:
        1. Update the `last` to be `last[S[i]]` given all `S[i]` need to be added into the substring.
        2. If `last == i`, we can make a cut right here, count and push the length of the substring into `ans` and update the `start, last` to be `i + 1`.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
            vector<int> v(26, 0);
            for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) v[S[i] - 'a'] = i;
            
            vector<int> res;
            int first = 0;
            int last = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
                last = max(last, v[S[i] - 'a']);
                if (last == i) {
                    res.push_back(last - first + 1);
                    first = last = last + 1;
                }
            }
            
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```

2. Merge Interval
    1. Find the interval `(i, j)` for each character such that `i` is the first position where the character shows and `j` is the last position where the character shows.
    2. Solve these intervals like the question [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/).
    3. The length of each merged interval will be the answer.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)
 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        if (S.empty()) return {};
        // Map the character to the index of it's interval in intervals array
        vector<int> v(26, -1);
        vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;
        
        // Store the interval of each character in the string in a intervals array with a index
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            int j = S[i] - 'a';
            // Initialize the interval if it's a new character
            if (v[j] == -1) {
                v[j] = intervals.size();
                intervals.push_back({i, i});
            } else {
                // Update the ending point for the character that already exists
                intervals[v[j]].second = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Solve the question - 56. Merge Intervals
        vector<int> res;
        int i = 0, last = 0;
        while (i < intervals.size()) {
            // Merge the current interval into the last if possible 
            while (i < intervals.size() && intervals[last].second >= intervals[i].first) {
                intervals[last].second = max(intervals[last].second, intervals[i].second);
                i++;
            }
            
            // Otherwise
            // Calculate the length of the last interval, and set the last interval to be the current interval
            res.push_back(intervals[last].second - intervals[last].first + 1);
            last = i;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
