Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

Thoughts:
1. The generalized version of the question [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)
2. One trick that can be applied here is, to make a transactions and have a profit, we have to at least use one day to buy, and another one day to sell, so totally two days for one transaction
   1. If the number of transactions we can make is greater than the number of days n divided by 2 (the most transactions we can make out of these n days), it means we can make as many as transcations we want, and the question will be simplified as `The maximum profit we can make out of these n days`, which can be solved greedly in `linear time`

```c++
//Time: O(Dk), D = # of days
//Space: O(D)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        int d = prices.size();
        
        // If k >= d/2, solve the question greedly in linear time
        if (k >= d/2) return findMaxProfit(prices);
        
        vector<int> sell(d, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Initial the local bestbuy for the first day
            int bestbuy = -prices[0];
            // Initial the local bestbuy for the first day, 0 since we can't sell on this day
            int bestsell = 0;
            
            // Use tmp 1d vector for the selling result of stock i
            vector<int> tmp_sell(d, 0);
            
            // Start from the second day
            for (int i = 1; i < d; i++) {
                
                bestsell = max(bestsell, bestbuy + prices[i]);
                bestbuy = max(bestbuy, sell[i - 1] - prices[i]);
                tmp_sell[i] = bestsell;
            }
            
            // Swap two vector to update the selling result
            sell.swap(tmp_sell);
        }
        
        return sell.back();
    }
    
    int findMaxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int p = 0;
        // Start from the second day, if the price is greater than yesterday, we buy yesterday and sell today
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) p += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
        return p;
    }
};
