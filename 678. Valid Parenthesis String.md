title: 678. Valid Parenthesis String
tags: String, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'` and `'*'`, write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
`'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string.
An empty string is also valid.

Example 1:
```
Input: "()"
Output: True
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "(*)"
Output: True
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "(*))"
Output: True
```
Note:
- The string size will be in the range [1, 100].

----------
Thoughts:
1. Count the number of open parenthesis as `count`
   1. Which we increment when meeting an open parenthesis, and decrement when meeting a close one.
   2. if it's a positive number, meaning it's expecting a close one to close it. 
   3. If it's a negative number, meaning the close ones are more than the open ones, which makes the string outright invalid (return false).
   4. If it's zero, meaning that the open and close parenthesis are completely canceled out, which is considered as a valid parenthesis string. 
2.  Given the presence of `*` which can represent either `(`, `)`, or `null`, the value of `count` essential diverge and branch into three possible conditions.
    1.  It can be solved in a Recursive manner, which has asymptotical time complexity of `O(3^K)` where `K = # of asterisks`.
    2.  Given the observation that the value of `count` of branches is continuous, we can just keep track of there boundary, as long as in the end, the value of `0` is in that range, there is one path of those branches yields a valid parenthesis string.

```Java
// Count the open parenthesis
// Time: O(N)
// Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
    	int low = 0;
    	int high = 0;
    	
    	for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
    		if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
    			low++;
    			high++;
    		} else if (s.charAt(i) == ')') {
                if (low > 0) {
    				low--;
    			}
    			high--;
    		} else {
    			if (low > 0) {
    				low--;
    			}
    			high++;
    		}
    		if (high < 0) {
                return false;
            }
    	}
    	return low == 0;
    }
}
```

```Java
// Recursive + pruning
// Time: O(3^K), K = # of '*'
// Space: O(K), consider system stack

class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
    	return checkValidString(0, 0, 0, s);
    }
    private boolean checkValidString(
    		int index, int left, int right, String s) {
    	if (index == s.length()) {
    		return left == right;
    	}
        if (right > left) {
            return false; 
        }
    	for (int i = index; i < s.length(); ++i) {
    		if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
    			left++;
        	} else if (s.charAt(i) == ')') {
        		right++;
                if (right > left) {
                    return false; 
                }
        	} else {
        		return checkValidString(i + 1, left + 1, right, s) ||
         			   checkValidString(i + 1, left, right + 1, s) ||
         			   checkValidString(i + 1, left, right, s);
        	}
    	}
    	return left == right;
    }
}
```
