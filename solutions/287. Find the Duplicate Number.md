title: 287. Find the Duplicate Number
tags: Binary Search, Two Pointers, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Note:

- You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
- You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
- Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
- There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

Thoughts:

**Solution 1: Binary Search**
1. Pick a middle value `i` from the range `[left:right]`, do the binary search based on the rules belows:
   1. Count the value `c` which is the number of values smaller or equal to `i` (include itself) in the array.
   2. If `c <= i`, means there is less than `i` elements of which the values lie in the value range `[1:i]`, which means there is no duplicate value in the range `[1:i]`, go search the interval `[i+1:right]`.
   3. If `c > i`, means there are more than `i` elements of which the value lie in the value range `[1:i]`, which means there most be duplicate values, go search the interval `[left:i]`.
```c++
//Time: O(NlogN)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 1, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            int smallEqualThan = 0;
            for (const int num : nums) {
                if (num <= mid) smallEqualThan++;
            }
            
            if (smallEqualThan <= mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
};

/*
[1,3,4,2,2]
min = 1, max = 4, mid = 2, count = 3
min = 1, max = 2, mid = 1, count = 1
min = 2, max = 2

*/
```


**Solution 2: List Cycle Detection** - [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
1. We "traverse" the values in the array as follow:
    1. Start with index 0
    2. See the `nums[i]` as the next index to go from index `i`
    3. If there is a duplicate value, means at the point the first duplicate shows up, we will have a cycle in the traversal, and the duplicate value will be the entry point of the cycle.
    4. Thus, to find the duplicate/entry point, we can solve this question just as [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int slow = 0, fast = 0;
        do {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        } while (slow != fast);
        
        fast = 0;
        while (fast != slow) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
