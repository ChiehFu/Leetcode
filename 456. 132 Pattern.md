title: 456. 132 Pattern

---

Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

Note: n will be less than 15,000.

Example 1:

```c++
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].

Example 3:
```c++
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Key points:
   1. Divide the problem into two sub problems
      1. Greedily find the largest possible `ak s.t. aj`, so that we can maximize the chance of finding a ai such that `ai < ak`.
      2. Find if there is any `ai < ak`.
2. Scan from right to left, use `s3` denote the largest `ak` we have found (pair with some `aj` such that `ak < aj`), when our current `value < ak`, we've found the answer.
3. To find the largest `ak, aj pair`, use a stack to keep the candidates that cen be used for `ak` (which are waiting for a `aj` later that is large enough to satisfy the condition `ak < aj`)
4. If current value is `> s3`, we use it as a new `aj`, and search in the stack the largest value that `< aj`, use it as the new `s3`.
5. Push the current value into the stack as it could also be a candidate of `s3`.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool find132pattern(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int s3 = INT_MIN;
        stack<int> st;
        
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1;  i >= 0; --i) {
            // If nums[i] < s3, we've find the pattern
            if (nums[i] < s3) return true;
            // Otherwise, use nums[i] as s2, and find the largest new s3 in the stack
            while (!st.empty() && nums[i] > st.top()) {
                // The stack is in increasing order because every time we pop out the values smaller than current s2 and pick the last one of those values as a new s3, and in the end push current s2 into the stack.
                s3 = st.top(); st.pop();
            }
            st.push(nums[i]);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
