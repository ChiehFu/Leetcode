title: 68. Text Justification
tags: String, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

Example 1:
```c++
Input:
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input:
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

Example 3:
```c++
Input:
words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

        while (index < words.size()) {
            // If current count is not greater than maxWidth, keep adding words for this line 
            while (index < words.size() && count + words[index].size() <= maxWidth) {
                // Add extra 1 space for each word as the space between current and next word
                count += words[index++].size() + 1;

            count -= 1;

            // Calculate the padding that can be evenly allocated between words under 2 conditions:
            // 1. There is only one word meaning no intervals needing the padding
            // 2. It's the last line, means we don't need extra padding (we already have one space between words)
      
            int pad = (index == words.size())? 0 : (index - start - 1 != 0)? (maxWidth - count)/(index - start - 1) : 0;

            // Calculate the space that can't evenly allocated between word under 2 condition:
            // 1. If there is one word or it's the last line, no padding needed
            // 2. Otherwise, compute how many remaining space we have to use

            int remain = (index - start - 1 != 0 && (index != words.size()))? (maxWidth - count)%(index - start - 1) : 0;

                // If this word is the end word of the line, just break
                if (i == index - 1) continue;

                // Add a basic space between words
                s += ' ';
                // Add the number of space that can distributed evenly between words
                for (int p = 0; p < pad; p++) s += ' ';

                if (remain-- > 0) s += ' ';
            }


            // When we under the following 2 conditions, we don't add extra padding between words:
            // 1. Only one word in this line
            // 2. This line is the last line
            // So we have to make this line having the same length by adding space to the end
            while (s.size() < maxWidth) s += ' ';
            res.push_back(s);
