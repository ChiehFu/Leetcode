Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```
Note:  

- 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
- n does not exceed 1690.

Thoughts:
1. Refer to the question [313. Super Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-ugly-number/)

```c++
//Multiple pointers 
//Time:  O(NK)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    struct number {
        int index;
        int val;
        number(int _val) {
            val = _val;
            index = 0;
        }
    };
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        vector<int> result(n);
        vector<number*> numbers{new number(2), new number(3), new number(5)};
        result[0] = 1;
        for (int l = 1; l < n; l++) {
            int next = INT_MAX;
            for (auto num : numbers) {
                next = min(next, result[num->index] * num->val);
            }
            for (auto num : numbers) {
                if (next == (result[num->index] * num->val)) num->index++;
            }
            result[l] = next;
        }
        return result[n - 1];
    }
};
