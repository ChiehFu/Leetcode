title: 70. Climbing Stairs

notebook: Leetcode

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Thoughts:
1. Use `dp[i]` to represent the numebr of ways to reach `ith` step.
2. When we are at step `i`, we can come from `i - 2 with 2 steps` or come from `i - 1 with 1 step`, so number of ways for `ith` step is `dp[i - 2]` + `dp[i - 1]`
3. Initial `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1`, start from 2th step and solve the problem based on previous sub-problems
4. Given that for each `ith` step, we only need the result of `(i - 2)th` and `(i - 1)th`, use `dp[0]`, and `dp[1]` will be sufficient(update the value after each step).

```c++
//DP
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int dp[2] = {1, 1};
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int num = dp[0] + dp[1];
            swap(dp[0], dp[1]);
            dp[1] = num;
        }
        return dp[1];
    }
};
```
