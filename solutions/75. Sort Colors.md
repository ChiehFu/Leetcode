title: 75. Sort Colors
tags: Two Pointers, medium
notebook: Leetcode

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Follow up:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
- First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

Thoughts:
1. Use three pointers `i, j, k` where `i = k = 0, j = n - 1`.
2. `i` is the pointer used for writing `0` from the head of the array, and `j` is the pointer used for writing `2` from the end the of array.
3. `k` is the pointer used to iterate the elements of the array and swap `0` with the pointer `i`, swap `2` with the pointer `j`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0, j = nums.size() - 1, k = 0;
        while (k <= j) {
            // Find the first elemnet not equal to 0 and be ready to swap with 0
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                i++;
                k = i;
            // Find the first elemnet not equal to 2 and be ready to swap with 0
            } else if (nums[j] == 2) { 
                j--;
            } else {
                if (nums[k] == 1) k++;
                else if (nums[k] == 0) swap(nums[i++], nums[k]);
                else swap(nums[j--], nums[k]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

```Java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (i <= r) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                swap(nums, i, l);
                l++;
                i++;
            } else if (nums[i] == 2) {
                swap(nums, i, r);
                r--;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = tmp;
    }
}
```

```Java
void sortColors(int A[], int n) {
    int n0 = -1, n1 = -1, n2 = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (A[i] == 0) 
        {
            A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1; A[++n0] = 0;
        } else if (A[i] == 1) 
        {
            A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1;
        } else if (A[i] == 2) 
        {
            A[++n2] = 2;
        }
    }
}
