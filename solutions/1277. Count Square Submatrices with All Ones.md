Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= arr.length <= 300
- 1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
- 0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1

Thoughts:
1. Similar to the question [221. Maximal Square](https://github.com/ChiehFu/leetcode/tree/master/solutions/221.%20Maximal%20Square.md), except that for each cell of `1s`, we're finding the longest side of it to count how may square of different length the cell can form with it's neighbor.
2. Accumulate the total number of squares along the process.
   
    ```Java
    //Dynamic Programming using 1D rolling dp table
    //Time: O(MN)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
        public int countSquares(int[][] matrix) {
            int m = matrix.length;
            int n = matrix[0].length;
            int[] preRow = new int[n];
            
            int result = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                int[] curRow = new int[n];
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    
                    int len = 1;
                    if (j > 0) {
                        len += Math.min(Math.min(preRow[j], preRow[j - 1]),
                                    curRow[j - 1]);
                    }
                    
                    curRow[j] = len;
                    result += curRow[j];
                }
                preRow = curRow;
            }
            
            return result;
        }
    }
    ```
