Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
Example:

Consider the following matrix:
```c++
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Start search from top-right.
2. If current value greater than the target, the target can't be within the current row, move to search next row.
3. If current value smaller than the target, the target can't be within the current column, move to the column on left side.
4. If find the target, return true, otherwise, return false in the end.

```c++
//Time: O(M + N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return false;
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        int row = 0, col = n - 1;
        
        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) return true;
            else if (matrix[row][col] > target) col--;
            else row++;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
