Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```
Note:
- You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two vectors to store the indices where two words shows in the input array separately.
2. Use two pointer to find out the minimal distance between the indices from two vector in `O(N)`

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
            vector<int> v1, v2;
            for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
                if (words[i] == word1) v1.push_back(i);
                if (words[i] == word2) v2.push_back(i);
            }
            int dst = words.size();
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < v1.size() && j < v2.size();) {
                dst = min(dst, abs(v1[i] - v2[j]));
                if (v1[i] > v2[j]) j++;
                else i++;
            }
            return dst;
        }
    };
    ```
3. Constant space Solution:
    1. Iterate over the array and keep track of the index `last` of the last word1 or word2.
    2. As we meet another word1 or word2:
        1. If it's not same as the word indexed by `last`, means these two words are one word1 and one word2, so calculate the distance between current index and `last`.
        2. Update the `last` index.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
            int dst = words.size();
            int index = -1;

            for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
                if (words[i] == word1 || words[i] == word2) {
                    if (index != -1 && words[index] != words[i]) {
                        dst = min(dst, i - index);
                    }
                    index = i;
                }
            }

            return dst;
        }
    };
    ```
