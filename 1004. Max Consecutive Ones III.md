Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

Example 1:

```c++
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```
Example 2:

```c++
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```
Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 20000
- 0 <= K <= A.length
- A[i] is 0 or 1

Thoughts:
1. Two Pointers with Sliding Window
2. Expand the window and keep track of the number of zeros in of current window.
3. Shrink the window from the left side to remove the zero once the number of zeros exceeds the limit.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int zeros = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (r < A.size()) {
            if (!A[r]) zeros++;
            while (zeros > K) {
                if (!A[l++]) zeros--;
            }
            ans = max(ans, r - l + 1);
            r++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
