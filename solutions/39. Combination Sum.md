title: 39. Combination Sum
tags: Back Tracking, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Backtracking to find all possible set of numbers.
2. Keep track of the value picked from in upstream recursion, in downstream recursion, start from that value again(as it's allowed to pick the same number multiple times, but don't pick the values before the position picked in upstream to avoid duplicates result set)

```c++
// Time: O(N^target)
// Space: O(target)
// It easier to analyze the time and space complexity in worst case as a upper bound
// When there are N elements and are all close to 1, we need to recursive roughly target times to pick roughly target number to make the sum to target

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> cur;
        helper(candidates, target, res, cur, 0);
        return res;
    }
    void helper(vector<int>& candidates, int target, vector<vector<int>> &res, vector<int> &cur, int start) {
        if (target < 0) return;
        else if (target == 0) {
            res.push_back(cur);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); ++i) {
            cur.push_back(candidates[i]);
            helper(candidates, target - candidates[i], res, cur, i);
            cur.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```
