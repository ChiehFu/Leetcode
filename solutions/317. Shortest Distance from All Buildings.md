title: 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
tags: Dynamic Programming, DFS, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
Example:

Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
Note:
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Scan through the matrix, for each `1`, do BFS to propagate the accumulate distance to zero.
2. Each zero will then accumulate the shortest distance passed from all `1` position, and in the mean time keep track of the number of the stores it has got value from. 
3. In the end, scan through the dis matrix and for those position with values `0` and has got distances from all houses, check it's accumulative distance value, and keep the minimal one across all `0` position.
