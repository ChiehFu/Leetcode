title: 463. Island Perimeter
tags: DFS, Easy
notebook: Leetcode

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example:

```
Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

Thoughts:
1. Solution 1:
   1. Every island has four sides, however, if there are two consecutive island, both of the island will lose one side.
   2. Iterate over the matrix, 
      1. Count how many island
      2. For each island, count it's left and top neighbor.
      3. The final perimeter will be `(# of islands) * 4 - (# of neighbors) * 2`
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int neighbor = 0;
            int island = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                        island++;
                        if (j > 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1) neighbor++;
                        if (i > 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1) neighbor++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return island * 4 - neighbor * 2;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Solution 2:
   1. Find the first island and start from there to recursively find it's neighbor islands.
   2. Every time we reach a neighbor island (either visited or haven't been visited), minus the total perimeter by 1, given the side between two islands will be invalid (the neighbor island later on will visit the previous island, and minus the total perimeter by 1 as well).
   3. If current island has been visited, return. 
   4. Otherwise, add `4` to the total perimeter for this new island and keep traversing it's neighbors recursively.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int perimeter = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                        perimeter = 1;
                        dfs(grid, i, j, perimeter);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            return perimeter;
        }
        void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int &perimeter) {
            if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size()) return;
            if (grid[i][j] != 0) perimeter -= 1;
            if (grid[i][j] != 1) return;
            grid[i][j] = -1;
            perimeter += 4;  
            dfs(grid, i + 1, j, perimeter);
            dfs(grid, i - 1, j, perimeter);
            dfs(grid, i, j + 1, perimeter);
            dfs(grid, i, j - 1, perimeter);
            return;
        }
    };
    ```
