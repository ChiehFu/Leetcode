Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

Example 3:
```
Input: 218
Output: false
```

----------
Thought:
1. The formula below produces the result of the input value `n` with it's rightmost `1` removed.
    ```
    res = n & (n - 1)
    ```
2. If `res` is `0`, it means that there is only one `1` in the binary representation of the value `n`, meaning that `n` is of power of `2`.
3. Use the formula to check if a given value is of power of `2` in constant time.

    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
            return n > 0 && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
        }
    }
    ```
