In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes u and v, where u is a parent of child v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.
```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
v   v
2-->3
```
```
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
Output: [4,1]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
5 <- 1 -> 2
     ^    |
     |    v
     4 <- 3
```

Note:
- The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
- Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

Thoughts:
1. The differences between the undirected graph and directed graph for this problem are:
2. In undirected graph, the only reason a edge causing a invalid tree would be there is a cycle.
3. However, in an undirected graph, nodes have parents and children relations, so there might be two reason for a tree to be invalid 
   1. A cycle
   2. A nodes having two parents 
4. To cover theses two possible cases, we solve it by the following steps:
   1. Identified the edges (if applicable) that cause a node to have two parents, mark them as the candidates
   2. Set the second edge to be removed (as the question asks for the edge that comes last)
   3. Use union-find to check if the tree is valid (no cycle)
   4. If there is a cycle:
      1. If there are no edges candidates, means this cycle is the original reason of the tree being invalud, return this edge 
      2. If there are, means this cycle is caused by we removing the wrong candidate, so the first candidate will be the answer
   5. If there is no cycle in the tree, means we've picked the right edge to remove, so return that removed edge
