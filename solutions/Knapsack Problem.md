Given the weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. We cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Here W <= 2000000 and n <= 500

Examples:
```
Input : W = 10, n = 3
        val[] = {7, 8, 4}
        wt[] = {3, 8, 6}
Output: 11
We get maximum value by picking items of 3 KG and 6 KG.
```
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int Knapsack(vector<int> &values, vector<int> &weights, int W);
int main()
{
    vector<int> values = {60, 100, 120};
    vector<int> weights = {10, 20, 30};
    int W = 50;
    cout << Knapsack(values, weights, W) << endl;
    return 0;
}

int Knapsack(vector<int> &values, vector<int> &weights, int W) {
    vector<int> dp(W + 1, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); i++) {
        vector<int> tmpDP(dp);
        for (int w = W; w >= weights[i]; w--) {
            tmpDP[w] = max(tmpDP[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
        }
        dp.swap(tmpDP);
    }
    return dp[W];
}
