Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

Example 1:

```C++
Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
```

Note:

- Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
- The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
- The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
- The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Maintain a map of stack, where the keys of the map are frequency counts which map to a stack of the elements having that frequency counts.
2. Use a hashmap to keep track of the amount/frequency of every numbers we push.
3. Use the frequency as the key, push the number to the stack with the corresponding key.
4. When we want to pop out a most frequent number, access the stack at the tail of the map (which has the greatest frequency), pop out one element from the stack.
5. Erase the key from the map if the stack has been empty.

```c++
class FreqStack {
public:
    FreqStack() {
        
    }
    
    void push(int x) {
        // Increase the frequency
        freq[x]++;
        // Push the number to the stack in the map having the corresponding frequency
        m[freq[x]].push(x);
    }
    
    int pop() {
        // Access the stack with greatest freq
        auto it1 = m.rbegin();
        // Pop out one element from the stack 
        int n = it1->second.top();
        it1->second.pop();

        // Remove the stack totally if it's been empty
        if (it1->second.empty()) m.erase(it1->first);

        // Reduce the frequency
        freq[n]--;
        return n;
    }
private:
    map<int, stack<int>> m;
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
};

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack* obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
