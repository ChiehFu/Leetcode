---

Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```

Thoughts:
1. Divide and conquer 
    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
            return helper(s, k, 0, s.size());
        }
        int helper(string &s, int k, int l, int r) {
            if (l >= r) return 0;
            vector<int> count(26, 0);
            for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {
                count[s[i] - 'a']++;
            }
            int max_len = 0;
            for (int i = l; i < r;) {
                int left = i;
                while (left < r && count[s[left] - 'a'] < k) left++;
                int right = left;
                while (right < r && count[s[right] - 'a'] >= k) right++;
                if (l == left && right == r) return r - l;
                max_len = max(max_len, helper(s, k, left, right));
                i = right;
            }
            return max_len;
        }
    };
    ```
