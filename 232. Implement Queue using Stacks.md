title: 232. Implement Queue using Stacks
tags: Stack, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Example:

MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
```
queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
```
Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use one stack for input(`push()`), one stack for output(`peek(), pop()`).
2. Push the element into stack one, when `peek(), pop()` is called, push all elements from stack one to stack two (so that the popping out order of the elements will be reversed), and we only pop out and peek element from the stack two as the output.
3. Only when we bottom out the stack two do we push all elements from stack one to stack two again to avoid breaking the original order of the remaining elements in the stack two.

```c++
//Time:  O(1) for push(), O(1) for each pop(), peek() (Amortized)
//Sapce: O(N)

class MyQueue {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    void push(int x) {
        in.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    int pop() {
        if (empty()) return INT_MIN;
        peek();
        int n = out.top(); out.pop();
        return n;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    int peek() {
        if (empty()) return INT_MIN;
        if (out.empty()) {
            while (!in.empty()) {
                out.push(in.top());
                in.pop();
            }
        }
        return out.top();
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    bool empty() {
        return in.empty() && out.empty();
    }
private:
    stack<int> in, out;
};

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue* obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj->push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 * int param_3 = obj->peek();
 * bool param_4 = obj->empty();
