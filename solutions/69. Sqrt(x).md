Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

```c++
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

Thoughts:

3 Solutions:
1. Binary Search
    1. Filter out the corner case where `x == 0`.
    2. Search in the interval `[1:n]` for the last value value `i` such that `i * i <= x` and `i` close to the value `x` as much as possible.
    3. Different to the normal binary search where we usually look for the first value in the interval that meets some criteria, here we are looking for the last value in the interval.
       1. When we meet a `i` such that `i^2 <= x`, check if `(i + 1)^2 > x`. if so, we know that `i` will be the last one.
    ```c++
    //Time: O(logN)
    //Space: O(1)
    class Solution {
    public:
        int mySqrt(int x) {

            if (x == 0) return 0;
            
            int l = 1, r = x;
            
            while (l <= r) {
                long m = l + (r - l) / 2;
                
                if (m * m == x) {
                    return m;
                } else if (m * m > x) {
                    r = m - 1;
                } else {
                    // If m * m <= x, check if m is the last qualified value in the sequence
                    if ((m + 1) * (m + 1) > x) return m;
                    else l = m + 1;
                }
            }
            return -1;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Bit Manipulation
   1. If we see the value in binary form, for a positive integer, it's at most `15`bits.
   2. Toggle each bit for a variable initialize as `0`, from the most-significant bit to the least-significant bit, to make the biggest variable `i` such that `i^2 <= x`.
   ```c++
    //Time: O(logN)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int mySqrt(int x) {
            if (x == 0 || x == 1) return x;
            
            int res = 0;
            // Set the mask to be the most-significant of x 
            int mask = 1<<((int)log2(x) - 1);
            
            while (mask) {
                if ((res|mask) <= x / (res|mask)) {
                    res |= mask;
                }
                mask = mask>>1;
            }
            
            return res;
        }
    };
   ```

    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int mySqrt(int a) {
            // f(x) = x^2 - a, find root of f(x)
            // Newton's method
            // f'(x) = 2x
            // x' = x - f(x) / f'(x) = x - (1/2*x - a/(2*x))
            //    = (x + a / x) / 2
            int x = a;
            while (x > a / x)
            x = (x + a / x) / 2;
            return x;
        }
    };
