notebook: Leetcode

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

1. Every rectangle is decided by a width and height
2. For a 1D case, `[1,1,0,0,0,1]`, to calculate the width of the rectangle, for each `1` that can forms a rectangle, keep track of the left and right boundary of the rectangle it belongs to
   1. Scan from left to right to assign the left boundary for each `1`, the left array will end up being like `left[0,0,x,x,x,5]`, the boundary of `non-rectangle` is not important.
   2. Scan from right to left to assign the right boundary like `right[1,1,x,x,x,5]`
   3. Calculate the area that can formed by each `1` as `(right[i] - left[i]) * height[i] (in 1d case, height is 1)`
   4. keep track of the maximal rectangle
3. Expand from 1d case to 2d case, of which the height is not always 1 anymore
   ```
    For the example like [0,1,1,0,1]
                         [1,1,1,0,0]
    1. calculate the left/right/height row by row as 1d case
    2. Accumulate the height if there are consecutive `1` at same position in different rows
    3. When current 1 inherits the height from the 1 from the previous row at the same index(namely, height[i] = height[i-1] + 1), it will subject to the left right boundary of that 1 from the previous row as well

                    right[j] = min(right[j], r);
                } else {
                    // If it's a 0, set the boundary to be n so that it won't affect the right boundary of the 1 in next row (as there is no height for that 1 to inherit)
