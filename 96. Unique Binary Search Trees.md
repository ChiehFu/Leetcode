Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

```
Example:

Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```
----------

Thoughts:
1. Use `dp[i]` to store the number of unique tree structures for i elements(in this question, it only depends on number of nodes in the interval, regardless of the value of the nodes)
2. For a binary tree in interval[i, j], if we pick the `node` at index `p` in interval [i, j] as a root, the number of unique Bt rooted as `node` will be `dp[p - i](left interval length) * dp[j - p](right interval length)`
3. Pick each node in the interval as a root, calculate and sum up the reuslt of all picked roots and it'll be the number of unique trees for this interval.
3. DP bottom-up
   1. Solve the problem by solving the sub-problems (small intervals) first
   2. Solve the big cases based on the small cases 
   ```
   interval i = 1 ~ n, picked root j = 1 ~ i
   dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
   ```   

```c++
Time: O(N^2)
Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

2. Recursive + memorization
    1. Top-down recursively solve the problem
    2. For each node i picked for the root, the number of combinations for the tree will be the prodect of the combinations of left and right subcases
    3. Memorize the solved problem (combination for i nodes (n = 1 ~ n))
```C++
Time: O(N^2)
Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        dp_.assign(n + 1, -1);
        dp_[0] = 1;
        dp_[1] = 1;
        return count(1, n);
    }
    int count(int l, int r) {
        if (dp_[r - l + 1] != -1) return dp_[r - l + 1];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            int left = count(l, i - 1);
            int right = count(i + 1, r);
            sum += left * right;
        }
        
        return dp_[r - l + 1] = sum;
    }
private:
    vector<int> dp_;
};
```
