title: 694. Number of Distinct Islands
tags: hash table, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of distinct islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.

Example 1:
```
11000
11000
00011
00011
```
Given the above grid map, return 1.

Example 2:
```
11011
10000
00001
11011
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. DFS for every island, for for each island, hash the traversal path and store in a hash set such that the identical islands will have the same hashed path.
2. The size of the hash set will be the number of distinct islands.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

    int numDistinctIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty() || grid[0].empty()) return 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    string s;
                    helper(grid, i, j, s, '0');
                    islands_.insert(s);
                }
            }
        }

        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != 1) {
            // Add a distinct char when we returning to make sure that every path is unique.
            s += 'b';
            return;
        }
        s += d;
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        for (int d = 0; d < dirs_.size(); d++) {
            int nxt_i = i + dirs_[d][0];
            int nxt_j = j + dirs_[d][1];
            helper(grid, nxt_i, nxt_j, s, d + '0');
        }

    vector<vector<int>> dirs_ = {{1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}};
