title: 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the original array, set a write index starting from the beginning of the array.
2. As we meet any integer for the first time, we write it to the write index, and move the forward the write index.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int w = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[w++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return w;
    }
};
```
