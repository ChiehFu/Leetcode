title: 141. Linked List Cycle
tags: Link List, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

            fast = fast->next;
            fast = fast->next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }

        return false;
