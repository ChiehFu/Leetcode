From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters (possibly no deletions).

Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences of source such that their concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
```

Constraints:

- Both the source and target strings consist of only lowercase English letters from "a"-"z".
- The lengths of source and target string are between 1 and 1000.

Thoughts:
1. Basic ideas: 
   1. Loop over the `target` with `i`.
   2. For each `target[i]`, greedily search in `source` by `j` to find a match, and `j` represent the position we're at for current subsequence.
   3. If `target[i]` is not in `source`, return `-1` directly.
   4. Otherwise:
      1. If we can find such `j`, move forward `i` by `1`.
      2. If we can't find such `j`, reset `j` to `0`, quit the current subsequence searching, and start a new one (Increase the number of subsequence needed by 1).
2. To efficiently find the index `k` that match `target[i]` such that `k > j`, we can store the indices of each character in `source`, and do a binary to look for a index of specific character in `source` having the index greater than `j`.

```c++
//Time:  O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWay(string source, string target) {
        vector<vector<int>> char_index(26);
        // For each character, store the indices where they shows in source
        for (int i = 0; i < source.size(); i++) char_index[source[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);
        // Initial the number of subsequence as 1
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < target.size();) {
            int c = target[i] - 'a';
            // If the current charter is not in source, return -1
            if (char_index[c].empty()) return -1;
            // Binary search for the current char in source that shows later than our current position in source
            auto it = lower_bound(char_index[c].begin(), char_index[c].end(), j);
            if (it == char_index[c].end()) {
                // Start a new subsequence matching from j = 0, and increase count 
                count++;
                j = 0;
            } else {
                // Update the current position
                j = *it + 1;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
3. In the solution above, we use binary search to search the index `k` for a char `a` such that `k > j`
    1. For each char `c` in `source`, we can build the array `next` such that `next[c][j]` is the index of `c` in source right next to `j`.
    2. For example, suppose the indices of `c` in source is `{1, 4, 6}` and `source.length() = 8`, the `next[c]` will be `{1,1,4,4,4,6,6,-1,-1}`, where `-1` represent there is no such character showing after the query index.
    3. This way, we can do the index search in `O(N)` with this pre-computed array.

```c++
//Time:  O(26 * M + N)
//Space: O(26 * M)

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWay(string source, string target) {
        vector<vector<int>> char_index(26, vector<int>(source.size(), -1));
        for (int i = 0; i < source.size(); i++) char_index[source[i] - 'a'][i] = i;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            for (int j = char_index[i].size() - 1, pre = -1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (char_index[i][j] == -1) char_index[i][j] = pre;
                else pre = char_index[i][j];
            }
        }
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < target.size();) {
            if (j == source.size()) {
                count++;
                j = 0;
            }
            int c = target[i] - 'a';
            if (j == 0 && char_index[c][j] == -1) return -1;
            j = char_index[c][j] + 1;
            if (j == 0) {
                count++;
                j = 0;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
