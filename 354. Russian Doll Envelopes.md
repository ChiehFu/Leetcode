You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers (w, h). One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside other)

Note:
- Rotation is not allowed.

Example:
```c++
Input: [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3 
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. 2D version of the question [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
    1. Dynamic programming
        1. Sort the pairs based on the widths
        2. Let `dp[i]` to be a number of doll(include self) that can be contained on doll index `i`
    2. Patient Sort (Optimal)
        1. Sort based on the widths(increasing) to simplify the question to 1D sequence
        2. For the pairs having same widths, we need to make them decreasing in heights.
            1. If we make them also increasing in heights, for the pair like `(3,3), (3,4)`, after we sort and remove the widths, will become `3, 4`, which will be considered as increasing, so we need to sort the pairs like `(3,4), (3,3)` so that `4, 3` won't be considered as increasing.

```c++
//Patient Sort (Optimal)
//Time: O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(vector<vector<int>>& envelopes) {
        //Sort the pair such that the pairs will increase in widths and for those pairs having the same widths, will drease in heights
        sort(begin(envelopes), end(envelopes), [] (const auto &a, const auto &b) {
            return (a[0] == b[0])? a[1] > b[1] : a[0] < b[0];
        });

        //Painent sort
        vector<int> v;
        for (const auto &e : envelopes) {
            auto it = lower_bound(begin(v), end(v), e[1]);
            if (it == end(v)) v.push_back(e[1]);
            else *it = e[1];
        }
        return v.size();
    }
};
```

```c++
//Dynamic Programming 
//Time: O(N*N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(vector<vector<int>>& envelopes) {
        if (envelopes.empty()) return 0;
        sort(begin(envelopes), end(envelopes));
        vector<int> dp(envelopes.size(), 1);

        int best = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < envelopes.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (greater(envelopes[i], envelopes[j])) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            best = max(best, dp[i]);
        }
        return best;
    }
    
    bool greater(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {
        return (a[0] > b[0]) && (a[1] > b[1]);
    }
};
