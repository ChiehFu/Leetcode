notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a 01 matrix M, find the longest line of consecutive one in the matrix. The line could be horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal.
Example:
```
Input:
[[0,1,1,0],
 [0,1,1,0],
 [0,0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

Hint: The number of elements in the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the array once and use extra space and keep track of the ones for each row/column/diagonals.
    1. How to keep track of the line of each directions.
       1. For the horizontal lines, since we move row by row, and then for a row, we can use one variable to keep track of the number of consecutive 1s we've seen.
       2. For the vertical lines, we use a vector of size `n` to keep track of the number of consecutive 1s for each column as we move horizontally.
       3. For two diagonals, use two vector of size `2n` separately, we map the position `(i, j)` to index `i + j` for the 135 degrees diagonal, and map to index `i - j + n - 1` for tje 45 degrees diagonal.
    2. As we move row by row, column by column, update the count of 1s in each corresponding vector by index, and keep track of the longest consecutive line of consecutive 1s.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestLine(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        if (M.empty() || M[0].empty()) return 0;
        int m = M.size(), n = M[0].size();
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> col(n, 0), diag(m + n, 0), anti_diag(m + n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int row = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (M[i][j] == 1) {
                    row++;
                    col[j]++;
                    diag[i - j + n]++;
                    anti_diag[i + j]++;
                    
                    ans = max({ans, row, col[j], diag[i - j + n], anti_diag[i + j]});
                } else {
                    row = 0;
                    col[j] = 0;
                    diag[i - j + n] = 0;
                    anti_diag[i + j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
1. Dynamic Programming
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestLine(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        if (M.empty() || M[0].empty()) return 0;
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(M.size(), vector<vector<int>>(M[0].size(), vector<int>(4, 0)));
        vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1}};
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < M.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M[0].size(); j++) {
                
                if (M[i][j] == 0) continue;
                
                // 4 directions
                for (int d = 0; d < dirs.size(); d++) {
                    // Initialize
                    dp[i][j][d] = 1;
                    ans = max(ans, 1);
                    
                    int d_i = i + dirs[d][0];
                    int d_j = j + dirs[d][1];
                    
                    if (d_i < 0 || d_j < 0 || d_i >= M.size() || d_j >= M[0].size()) continue;
                    if (M[d_i][d_j] == 0) continue;
                    
                    dp[i][j][d] += dp[d_i][d_j][d];
                    ans = max(ans,  dp[i][j][d]);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
