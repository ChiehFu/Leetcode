title: 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
tags: Priority Queue, Merge Interval, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
```

Note:

- The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
- 1 <= k <= 3500
- -10^5 <= value of elements <= 10^5.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Think of a sorted list consisting of k sorted lists from original input.
2. Our target is to find a interval `[begin, end]` with the smallest value of `val[end] - val[begin]` in this new sorted list such that the interval `[start, end]` contains exactly 1 element from k different lists.
3. We can apply the technique used in the question 	
[Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists), where we use a Priority Queue to keep 1 element of K different lists at the time, and when the size of the queue is `k`, we have exactly 1 element from each list.
4. Measure the interval enclosed by min/max values of the current k elements in the queue and find the optimal one.

```c++
//Time:  O(MNlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    struct ele {
        int val;
        int row;
        int col;
        ele(int v, int r, int c):val(v), row(r), col(c){}
    };
    vector<int> smallestRange(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        auto cmp = [&nums] (const ele &p1, const ele &p2) {
            return p1.val > p2.val;
        };
        
        priority_queue<ele, vector<ele>, decltype(cmp)> q(cmp);
        
        int hi = 1e-5;
        
        // Since we can get the minimum from a min-heap directly, we use extra variable to keep track of the maximum as we add new value into the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            q.push(ele(nums[i][0], i, 0));
            hi = max(hi, nums[i][0]);
        }
        
        int begin = 1e-5, end = 1e5;
        
        // Only consider the case where there are k elements in the queue
        while (q.size() == nums.size()) {
            auto cur = q.top(); q.pop();
            if (hi - cur.val < end - begin) {
                begin = cur.val;
                end = hi;
            }
            
            if (cur.col + 1 < nums[cur.row].size()) {
                q.push(ele(nums[cur.row][cur.col + 1], cur.row, cur.col + 1));
                hi = max(hi, nums[cur.row][cur.col + 1]);
            }
        }   
        
        return {begin, end};
    }
};
