title: 1138. Alphabet Board Path
tags: String, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

On an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].

Here, board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"], as shown in the diagram below.

We may make the following moves:

'U' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
'D' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
'L' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
'R' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
'!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.
(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)

Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.

Example 1:
```
Input: target = "leet"
Output: "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: target = "code"
Output: "RR!DDRR!UUL!R!"
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= target.length <= 100
- target consists only of English lowercase letters.

----------
Thoughts:
1. For a character, map it the the 2D board with index 
`i = (c - 'a') / 5` and `j = (c - 'a') % 5`.
2. The number of step of four directions we need to take will be the difference between the current character's axises and the next character's axises.
    ```
    For Example: 
    For left and right, the step we need to take will be the abs value of i - nxt_i, the the sign of the value indicates whether it's move left or right.
    And vice versa for moving up and down.
    ```
3. There are some special cases where the order of the directing we take matters.
    ```
    If we are at 'z', the only direction we can move is up
    If we are at 'v', 'w', 'x' and 'y', we can't move downwards.
    To have a general traversal ordering that takes into account the restrictions above, we can always move upwards first, and move downwards last to cover those two restrictions, between this two, we can move left and right at our will.
    ```
3. Having assign the priority to the four directions, for each traversal from character a to b, we can directly calculate and form the string of the path we move.
4. Otherwise, we can just do a normal traversal where at each character, we move according to a ordering, and at the beginning of the recursion, we always check if the current position is valid (not out of boundary).


    ```C++
    //DFS and check the boundary
    //Time:  O(N * 2^6), the shortest movement from a to b will involve at most 2 directions.
    //Space: O(6)
