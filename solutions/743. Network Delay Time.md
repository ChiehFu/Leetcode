title: 743. Network Delay Time
tags: Graph, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
```

Note:

1. N will be in the range [1, 100].
2. K will be in the range [1, N].
3. The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
4. All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.

Thoughts:
1. Single source shortest path
   1. Can be solve by [Balleman ford](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-simple-implementation/) algorithm

```c++
// Time: O(NE)
// Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int N, int K) {
        const int max = 101 * 100;
        vector<int> delay(N + 1, max);
        delay[K] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
            for (const auto &time : times) {
                delay[time[1]] = min(delay[time[1]], delay[time[0]] + time[2]);
            }
        }
        
        // negative cycle detection
        // for (auto &time : times) {
        //     if (delay[time[0]] + time[2] < delay[time[1]]) return -1;
        // }
        
        int maxDelay = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < delay.size(); i++) {
            maxDelay = max(maxDelay, delay[i]);
        }
        
        return (maxDelay == max)? -1 : maxDelay;
    }
};
