title: 11. Container With Most Water
tags: Two Pointers, medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:
```c++
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two pointers `left, right` as the left and right side wall which can contain water.
2. Move the pointers according the the following rules to find the possible maximal area:
    1. For two sides `left, right`, the amount of water is restricted by the lower side, so the only chance we can find any area larger than current area is by moving the lower side (even the distance between two sides is shorten, we have chance the find a higher wall). 
    2. Each time, calculate the area formed by current two sides and compare `left, right`, move the lower side.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int l = 0, r = height.size() - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            if (height[l] < height[r]) {
                ans = max(ans, (r - l) * height[l]);
                l++;
            } else {
                ans = max(ans, (r - l) * height[r]);
                r--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
