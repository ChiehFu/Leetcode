title: 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
tags: Linked List, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For k = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For k = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

Note:

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Solve the question recursively.
2. For a linked list starting with `head`, find the node `end` such that `[head, end) (not include end)` is a group of length `k`.
3. Solve the subsequent problem for list starting from `end`, and get the new head `sub_head` returned from the subproblem.
4. Solve(reverse) the current group and get the new `head`(previous `end`) and `end`(previous `head`), link `end` to the `sub_head`.

//Space:  O(N/k)

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (!head) return head;
        int c = 0;
        auto p = head;
        while (p && c < k) {
            c++;
            p = p->next;
        }
        // If the linked list is shorter than k
        if (c < k) return head;
        // Else
        // Reverse the linked list [head, p)
        auto new_head = reverse(head, p);
        // Solve the sub-problem starting from p
        head->next = reverseKGroup(p, k);
        return new_head;
    }
    
    ListNode* reverse(ListNode* start, ListNode* end) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        while (start != end) {
            auto next = start->next;
            start->next = dummy->next;
            dummy->next = start;
            start = next;
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
