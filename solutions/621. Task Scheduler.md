Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

Note:
1. The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2. The integer n is in the range [0, 100].


**Solution 1:**

```
{A:5, B:5, C:3, D:1}
A . A . A . A . A
A will form the interval
```
Thoughts:
   1. Consider n + 1 as one cycle, and each task can be processed at most once within each cycle.
   2. So the total interval for all tasks will be decided by the task that present most frequently, since this task require most interval and other tasks can just fit into this interval. 
   3. Consider the number of the biggest frequency as `F`, and there are `T` tasks that have that frequency, we at least need `(F - 1) * cycle + T` to finish all tasks.
   4. There might be the case say that `n = 1`, random `F` and `T`, however if there are more than `n` tasks that have `F - 1 ` frequency, the interval between task `F` will be extended from `n` to `F - 1`, so in this case, we at lease need `L` to finish all tasks where `L = len(tasks)`.
   5. Compare 3 and 4 to reture the bigger one.

```
Case 1:
{A:5, B:5, C:3, D:1}
n = 1
A and B form the intervals, B and C can just be stuffed into the intervals
AB . AB . AB. AB. AB 

Case 2:
{A:5, B:4, C:4, D:4}
n = 1
A forms the intervals of four, B, C, D all needs exactly 4 interval to fit, the original interval will be extended (from 1 to 3)
A . A . A . A . A
A BCD A BCD A BCD A BCD A

We can't konw which will be the case without actually fit the remained tasks in to the intervals, but the total interval will need to fit this two cases so just reture the one that is larger. 
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:    
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        vector<int> counts(26, 0);
        int max_count = -1;
        int num_of_max = -1;
        for (const char &task : tasks) {
            int index = task - 'A';
            counts[index] += 1;
            if (counts[index] == max_count) {
                num_of_max += 1;
            } else if (counts[index] > max_count) {
                max_count = counts[index];
                num_of_max = 1;
            }
        }
        int sum = (max_count - 1) * (n + 1) + num_of_max;
        sum = max(sum, int(tasks.size()));
        return sum;
    }
};

Time : O(L), L = tasks.size()
Space : O(1), 26
```

**Solution 2:**
    
Thoughts:
1. The most frequent case needs to be finish first, so the total interval can be exactly the most frequency - 1.
2. Use Greddy to pick the most frequent task in in each cycle.
3. Use `priority_queue (default max heap)`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:    
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        vector<int> counts(26, 0);
        // Use vector to speed up
        for (const char &task : tasks) {
            counts[task - 'A'] += 1;
        }

        // By default Max Heap, compare the first element of the pair 
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < counts.size(); i++) {
            if (counts[i]) pq.push(make_pair(counts[i], i + 'A'));
        }
        int res = 0;
        int cycle = n + 1;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            vector<pair<int, char>> tmps;
            int i = 1;
            // In each cycle, select the tasks and put into the tmps, from the most frequent one to the lease frequent one. 
            for (i; i <= cycle; i++) {
                // If no more tasks for this cycle, break.
                if (pq.empty()) break;
                else {
                    tmps.push_back(pq.top());
                    pq.pop();
                }
            }
            // Iterate over tmps, reduce the number that remains by 1 for each tasks, push back the tasks to the heap that greater than 1 (needs to be processed in the next cycle)
            for (auto &tmp : tmps) {
                if (--tmp.first) {
                    pq.push(tmp);
                }
            }
            // count the lift time, two cases, when we finish all tasks, we don't have next interval, so we only need to add the number of tasks in this cycle to total life time, other wise, add cycle length.
            res += (!pq.empty())? cycle : i - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

Time : O(nlogn * f), n = # of task in a cycle, f = greatest frequency
Space : O(L), L = tasks.size()
```
