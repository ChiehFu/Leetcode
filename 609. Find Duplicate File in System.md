title: 609. Find Duplicate File in System

notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, you need to find out all the groups of duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths.

A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have exactly the same content.

A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:

"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"

It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt with content f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content, respectively) in directory root/d1/d2/.../dm. Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The output is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:

"directory_path/file_name.txt"

Example 1:

```c++
Input:
["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output:  
[["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]
```

Note:

No order is required for the final output.
You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and digits, and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].
The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].
You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path and file info are separated by a single blank space.
 

Follow-up beyond contest:
Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?

----------
Thoughts:
1. Find the directory, file content of the file.
2. Hash the file content and map it to the file full file path (use stringstream to separate the string by specific delimiter)
3. Push the file group that greater than size of 2 into the result

```c++
Time: O(NK), N = #. of files, K = file size
Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> findDuplicate(vector<string>& paths) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> files;
        for (const auto path : paths) {
            stringstream s(path);
            string dir = "";
            getline(s, dir, ' ');
            string file = "";
            while (getline(s, file, ' ')) {
                int index = file.find('(');
                string content = file.substr(index);
                files[content].push_back(dir + '/' + file.substr(0, index));
            }
        }
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        for (const auto file : files) {
            if (file.second.size() >= 2) {
                result.push_back(file.second);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

Follow-up beyond contest:
1. Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
    1. I will use DFS rather than BFS as BFS costs more memory than DFS in general file system(a folder with 100 files v.s. a file with 100 level of directories)
2. If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
    1. Map all the files according to size. Files with different sizes are guaranteed to be different. We will than hash a small part of the file with equal size (using MD5 for example). Only if the MD5 is the same, we will compare the file byte by byte
3. If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
    1. We can create the hash from the 1kb chunks, and then read the entire file if a full byte by byte comparison is required.
4. What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
    1. Time complexity is O(N^2*K) since in worse case we might need to compare the file to all others. K is the file size
    2. Comparing the file(by size, by hash and eventually byte by byte) is the most time consuming part
    3. Generating hash for every file will be the most memory consuming part
    4. Optimize it by the procedure above, compare the file size first, only when the sizes are the same then we compare hashes, and only when  the hashes are the same then we compare byte by byte
5. How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
    1. Use several filters to compare. File size, hash and byte by byte comparison
