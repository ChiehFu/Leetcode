title: 142. Linked List Cycle II
tags: LInk List, medium, Two Pointers
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

```c++
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:

```c++
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

----------
Thoughts:
1. Traverse the linklist by two pointers, `slow, fast`, for each time, `slow` takes one step and `fast` takes two steps.
2. If there is a cycle in the linklist, `slow` and `fast` will eventually meet somewhere.
3. Suppose:
   1. `i` is the distance between the beginning of the list and the entry of the cycle of length `c`.
   2. `j` is the distance between the entry of the cycle and the node where `slow` and `fast` pointer meet for the first time.
   3. Suppose when two pointers meet:
      1. `slow` has moved `i + j + (n)c` steps, where `n` can be any positive integer.
      2. `fast` has moved `i + j + (k)c` steps, where `k` can be any positive integer.
      3. Given `fast` moves 2 times as fast as `slow` moves, we can get the following equations:
      ```c++
        2(i + j + (n)c) = i + j + (k)c
        i + j = (m)c, where m = n - k
        i = (m)c - j
      ```
      1. For `slow` pointer, which has already moved `j` from the entry of the cycle, moving `(m)c - j` will complete a cull cycle and bring it back to the entry, and the distance it moves is also same as `i`.
      2. So we can set a new pointer at the beginning of the list, and move it and `slow` simultaneously, they will meet exactly at the entry node of the cycle. 

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;  
        
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
            fast = fast->next;
            if (slow == fast) break;
        }
        
        if (!fast || !fast->next) return nullptr;
        
        ListNode *entry = head;
        while (slow != entry) {
            slow = slow->next;
            entry = entry->next;
        }
        
        return entry;
    }
};
```
