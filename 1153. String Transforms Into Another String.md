Given two strings str1 and str2 of the same length, determine whether you can transform str1 into str2 by doing zero or more conversions.

In one conversion you can convert all occurrences of one character in str1 to any other lowercase English character.

Return true if and only if you can transform str1 into str2.


Example 1:

Input: str1 = "aabcc", str2 = "ccdee"
Output: true
Explanation: Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "leetcode", str2 = "codeleet"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to transform str1 to str2.
 

Note:

- 1 <= str1.length == str2.length <= 10^4
- Both str1 and str2 contain only lowercase English letters.

----------

Thoughts:
1. Every time we transform a letter in str1 into the corresponding letter in str2, we need to transform all same letters in str1, so the mapping from letters in str1 to lengths in str2 can't be one-to-many, like the strings ` aaa and abb, where we have the mapping a -> c, and a -> b`.
2. If all distinct letters in str1 and str2 are same, it means we can't directly transform the letter `a` in str1 into the corresponding letter `b` in str2, because later on, if we need to transform `b` in str1 into `c` in str2, the previous `b` transformed from `a` in str1 will also be transformed into `d`. 
   1. For this kind of situation, we need one extra letter that is not shown in both str1 and str2 as an intermediate letter, such that we can use to break the circle in the mapping between str1 and str2. 
   2. So if str1 and str2 not contain all possible 26 alphabet letters, we can use the one that is not contained as that intermediate letter, otherwise, we can't transform str1 into str2

```c++
// Time : O(min(26, L))
// Space: O(26)

class Solution {
public:
    bool canConvert(string str1, string str2) {
        if (str1.size() != str2.size()) return false;
        if (str1 == str2) return true;
        
        vector<int> maping(26, -1);
        vector<int> freq1(26, 0), freq2(26, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < str1.size(); ++i) {
            if (maping[str1[i] - 'a'] == -1) maping[str1[i] - 'a'] = str2[i] - 'a';
            else if (maping[str1[i] - 'a'] != str2[i] - 'a') return false;
            
            ++freq1[str1[i] - 'a'];
            ++freq2[str2[i] - 'a'];
        }
        
        int common = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if ((freq1[i] == 0) ^ (freq2[i] == 0)) return true;
            if ((freq1[i] != 0) && (freq2[i] != 0)) ++common;
        }
        return common != 26;
    }
};
```
