title: 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers
tags: heap, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

- Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
- Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.

Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

Example 1:
```
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers separately. 
```
Note:

- 1 <= K <= N <= 10000, where N = quality.length = wage.length
- 1 <= quality[i] <= 10000
- 1 <= wage[i] <= 10000
- Answers within 10^-5 of the correct answer will be considered correct.
