Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.


Example 1:
```
Input: 6
Output: 7
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 11
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 13
Output: 101
```
Note:

- 1 <= N <= 10^8
- The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.

Thoughts:
1. Key Observation:
   1. All palindrome number with even digit can be divided by `11` ([Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/discuss/146798/All-Even-Digits-Palindrome-are-Divisible-by-11))
   2. For number `N, 8 <= N <= 11`, their prime palindrome number is `11`, for other number, we need finding the palindrome value with odd digit for them.

    ```c++
    /*
    O(10000) to check all numbers 1 - 10000.
    isPrime function is O(sqrt(x)) in worst case.
    But only sqrt(N) worst cases for 1 <= x <= N
    In general it's O(logx)
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        int primePalindrome(int N) {
            if (N >= 8 && N <= 11) return 11;
            for (int i = 1; i < 1e5; ++i) {
                string s = to_string(i), t(s.rbegin(), s.rend());
                int n = stoi(s + t.substr(1));
                if (n >= N && isPrime(n)) return n;
            }
            return -1;
        }

        bool isPrime(int num) {
            if (num <= 2 || num % 2 == 0) return num == 2;
            for (int i = 3; i * i <= num; i += 2) {
                if (num % i == 0) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
