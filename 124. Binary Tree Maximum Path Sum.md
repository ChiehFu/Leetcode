title: 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
tags: Tree, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:

```Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```

```
Example 2:

Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```

Thoughts:
1. Do DFS to the tree
2. At each node, we will get two max sum of the paths that end with it's two children separately.
3. We can find the local maximum and update the global maximum in three cases below:
    - current + left + right
    - current + left
    - current + right
4. After updating the local maximum, return the longer path that is ended with current, so that current's parent can use. `return max(current, max(current + left, current + right))`

    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int max_sum = INT_MIN;
        dfsFindMaxSum(root, max_sum);
        return max_sum;
    }
    int dfsFindMaxSum(TreeNode* root, int &max_sum) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        int l = dfsFindMaxSum(root->left, max_sum);
        int r = dfsFindMaxSum(root->right, max_sum);
        
        l = l > 0? l : 0;
        r = r > 0? r : 0;
        
        max_sum = max(max_sum, root->val + l + r);
        
        return l > r? root->val + l : root->val + r;
    }
};
