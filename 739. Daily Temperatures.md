title: 739. Daily Temperatures
tags: stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a stack to store the day index in the past.
2. For each day index `i`, check if there are days index `j` in the past such that `T[i] > T[j]`, which means day `j` has to wait `i - j` day to meet the first warmer day.
3. Pop out day `j` and store the number of days in the result array `res[j] = i - j`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& T) {
        stack<int> days;
        vector<int> res(T.size(), 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (!days.empty() && T[i] > T[days.top()]) {
                int j = days.top(); days.pop();
                res[j] = i - j;
            }
            days.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
