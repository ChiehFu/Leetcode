title: 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
tags: Array, Greedy, Easy
notebook: Leetcode

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Given we can do as many transactions as possible as long as we start a new one after finish the last one, we are essentially looking for increasing numbers in the prices. (buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point)
2. The profit will be the sum of the highest point - lowest point of the increasing sequences in the prices
3. We don't have to find the lowest buying price and the highest selling price, we can just keep a candidate of buying price and greedly do the transaction as long as there is a profit, and update the set the candidate of buying price to next price.
```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        // Keep track of a lowest price
        int lowest = INT_MAX;
        int profit = 0;
        for (auto &price : prices) {
            // sell is there is a profit
            if (price > lowest) {
                profit += price - lowest;
            }

            // update the next lowest
            lowest = price;
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```
