title: 1048. Longest String Chain
tags: medium, hash table, Dynamic Programming
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >= 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```

Note:

- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
- words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Think of this question as a traversal problem, where each word `a` can go to it's successor `b`(i.e., `a` is `b`'s predecessor).
2. The length of a predecessor and a successor must differ by `1`, so first we group the words by the length and store in a hash table, so that for a word of length `k`, we can pull out it's successor candidates of length `k + 1` directly.
3. Memorize the problem we solved during the traversal as we may meet this subproblem again in others word's traversal
4. Do the traversal from two perspectives
   1. Start from a `predecessor` and sequentially find the `successor` of the current word
   2. Start from a `successor` and sequentially find the `predecessor` of the current word 

```c++
//Time: O(N) ~ Worst case O(S * N^2), Image there are only two kinds of length k and k + 1, every word of length k+1 are the candidate of the successor of every word of length k. There are totally N^2 combination and each combination takes O(S) to validate

//Space: O(N)
