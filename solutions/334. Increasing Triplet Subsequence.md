Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

Return true if there exists i, j, k
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Greedily find the triple subsequence.
2. Let `p1`, `p2` be the best(minimal) last element of the one-cell/two-cell subsequence so far.
   1. Don't think of `p1, p2` as the first and second element of the triplet we've found sofar.
   2. Similar idea can refer to the patient sort algorithm used in the question [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
    ```
    In the example like [3, 4, 0 , 5], 
    p1, p2 will end up being p1 = 0, p2 = 4, if we just look at the value, it is obviously that p1 need doesn't come before p2, however the values stored in p1, p2 is not the value of the triplet, instead, it's the minimal value of the one-cell/two-cell subsequence so far.

    And we can visualize the changes of p1 and p2 as follow:

        0  1  2  3  4
    p1  3  3  0  0  
    p2  -  4  4  4  

    and we can see at index 2, even the value of p1 changes from 3 to 0, the fact that there is one value (which is 0) goes before p2 (which is 4) is still hold true, so when we meet 5 at index 4 (which is greater than p2), we know we've found the triplet.

    So the values stored in p1 and p2 should be regarded as the best(minimal) last element of the 1-cell/2-cell sequence so far.
    ```
3. If we find any number `> p2`, we've found the triplet subsequence.

    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool increasingTriplet(vector<int>& nums) {
            int p1 = INT_MAX, p2 = INT_MAX;
            for (auto num : nums) {
                if (num <= p1) {
                    p1 = num;
                } else if (num <= p2) {
                    p2 = num;
                } else return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    };
    ```
