Given a string s, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Reverse the original string `s` as `rev_s`, the longest palindrome we an make is concat `s` to `rev_s`, for example:
   ```c++
            s =     "aabc"
        rev_s = "cbaa" 
   palindrome = "cbaaaabc"
   ``` 
2. However, if there is a prefix of `s` which is also a a suffix of `rev_s`, we can make the palindrome shorter by leverage this overlapping substring as the example below:
    ```c++
            s =   "aabc"
        rev_s = "cbaa" 
   palindrome = "cbaabc"
   ``` 
3. Use KMP algorithm to find such overlapping substring in time `O(L + L)`
```c++
//Time:  O(L)
//Space: O(L)

class Solution {
public:
    string shortestPalindrome(string s) {
        string rev_s(s.rbegin(), s.rend());

        // If the string is already a palindrome, return it directly
        if (rev_s == s) return s;
        
        // build longest-prefix-suffix table for s
        vector<int> lps(s.size(), 0);
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        while (j < s.size()) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                lps[j] = i + 1;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                if (i == 0) j++;
                else i = lps[i - 1];
            }
        }

        // Find prefix of s which is also a suffix of rev_s
        i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < rev_s.size()) {
            if (rev_s[i] == s[j]) {
                j++;
                i++;
            } else {
                if (j == 0) i++;
                else j = lps[j - 1];
            }
        }
        
        // Concat the non-overlapping-prefix substring to the reverse of the original string
        return rev_s + s.substr(j);
    }
};
```
