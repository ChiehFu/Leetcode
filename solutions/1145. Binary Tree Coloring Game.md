title: 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game
tags: Tree, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.

 

Example 1:
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/01/1480-binary-tree-coloring-game.png)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.
```
Constraints:

- root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
- n is odd.
- 1 <= x <= n <= 100

----------
Thoughts:
1. The key point is to find the three possible subtrees we can pick after the first pick has been made.
   1. Two subtrees are the subtrees of picked node.
   2. Another subtree is the one starting from picked node's parent but excluding the subtree starting from picked node.
   3. If and max subtree has the nodes more than half of the total nodes, we can ensure to win by picking the root of that subtree.
2. DFS search in the tree for the picked node, and also for each recursion, we return the number of node of the subtree starting from the current node.
3. If we find the picked node, we store the count of the it's two subtrees `l and r`, and return all the way back to the origin.
4. Calculate the third count which is `total - 1 - l - r`.
5. Check if the max count among this three count greater than half of the total number of nodes.
