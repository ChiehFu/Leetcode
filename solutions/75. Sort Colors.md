title: 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Follow up:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
- First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

Thoughts:
1. Use three pointers `i, j, k` where `i = k = 0, j = n - 1`.
2. `i` is the pointer used for writing `0` from the head of the array, and `j` is the pointer used for writing `2` from the end the of array.
3. `k` is the pointer used to iterate the elements of the array and swap `0` with the pointer `i`, swap `2` with the pointer `j`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0, j = nums.size() - 1, k = 0;
        while (k <= j) {
            // Find the first elemnet not equal to 0 and be ready to swap with 0
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                i++;
                k = i;
            // Find the first elemnet not equal to 2 and be ready to swap with 0
            } else if (nums[j] == 2) { 
                j--;
            } else {
                if (nums[k] == 1) k++;
                else if (nums[k] == 0) swap(nums[i++], nums[k]);
                else swap(nums[j--], nums[k]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
