Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Define the question in a general form - `Given an array of numbers, all numbers show exact k times except for one number that only shows p times, find that number in linear time`, and refer to the solution in the question [136. Single Number.md](https://github.com/ChiehFu/leetcode/tree/master/solutions/136.%20Single%20Number.md).
2. In this case, `k = 3 and p = 1`, so we use `2` counters to count the occurrence of `1 ~ k`.
3. Reset the counters at `kth` counts, and in the end, get the number that is counted `p` times from the counters.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int c0 = 0, c1 = 0;
        int mask = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            c1 ^= c0 & num;
            c0 ^= num;
            
            // Set a mask that has a bit zero on the position corresponding to the position in counters c0 and c1 and has a count of k
            // k in this case is 3, which is 11 in binary form, so set mask to be ~(c0 & c1) 
            mask = ~(c0 & c1);
            c0 &= mask;
            c1 &= mask;
        }
        
        return c0;
    }
}
```
