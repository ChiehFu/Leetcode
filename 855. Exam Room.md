In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.

Example 1:
```
Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
Explanation:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
​​​​
```

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 10^9
- ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 10^4 times across all test cases.
- Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently sitting in seat number p.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a set `taken` to store those seats taken in order.
2. For two taken seat index `a, b`:
   1. The maximal distance to the closest person ` = (b - a) / 2`.
   2. The index of that seat ` = (a + b) / 2`
3. To pick a optimal seat, iterate over the taken seat and find the seat based on 4 conditions:
   1. If there is no seat taken (`taken.empty() == true`), take seat `0`.
   2. If seat `0` is not taken, consider taking it with the distance `*(taken.front()) - 0`.
   3. If seat `N - 1` is not taken, consider taking it with the distance `N - 1 - *(taken.rbegin())`.
   4. Consider the seat between taken seats and calculate the distance and position as mentioned at step `2`.
4. Add the seat picked into the set, and erase it from the set when `leave()` gets called.
