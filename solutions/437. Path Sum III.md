title: 437. Path Sum III
tags: Tree, hash table, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

```c++
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

Thoughts:
1. A tree version of the question [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/).
2. Basically, traverse the tree and and maintain a hashmap containing the prefix sum of the path from the root to the current node, and for each node with a prefix sum, we find the corresponding prefix sum such that the difference between two prefix sum can make to the target value.
3. As we traverse the tree, update the hash table for different branches.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        // Initial with one 0 to cover the case where prefix sum itself can make to the target sum
        sums[0]++;
        count = 0;
        helper(root, 0, sum);
        return count;
    }
    void helper(TreeNode* node, int acc, int sum) {
        if (!node) return;
        // Maintain an accumulative sum whose value equal to the sum from root to current node
        acc += node->val;
        // For current accumulative sum, look for the prefix sum such that acc - prefix = sum
        if (sums.count(acc - sum)) count += sums[acc - sum];
        // Add current accumulative sum into the hash table
        sums[acc]++;
        
        // Go to it's children's branch
        helper(node->left, acc, sum);
        helper(node->right, acc, sum);

        // As we return to the upstream, remove the current accumulative sum from the hash table
        if (--sums[acc] == 0) sums.erase(acc);
    }
private:
    unordered_map<int, int> sums;
    int count;
};
