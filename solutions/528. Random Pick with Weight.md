title: 528. Random Pick with Weight
tags: Binary Search, medium, Array
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

- 1 <= w.length <= 10000
- 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
- pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
  
Example 1:

```c++
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
```

Explanation of Input Syntax:

- The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Assign each index with the interval that equals to the amount of it's weight in an array, so that when we randomly pick a number within the array, we pick the index of the interval which the number lies in, and the probability of the number being in a certain interval of index is proportional to the weight of the index assigned.
2. For the example like `[1, 3, 2, 1]`, we will have an interval array like `interval = [0, 1, 4, 6], total = 7`, where the interval in `interval[i] ~ interval[i + 1] - 1` is taken for the `index[i]` and `interval[i]` is the starting point of the interval, and `i` is also the index of that interval
   1. When we randomly select a number, binary search for the first value `<=` the random number (will be the starting point and index of the interval the random number lies in) in the interval array, and return that index.

```c++
//Time: O(W), W = the sum of the weights
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& w) {
        acc_ = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < w.size(); i++) {
            intervals_.push_back(acc_);
            acc_ += w[i];
        }
        srand(time(NULL));
    }
    
    int pickIndex() {
        if (acc_ != 0) {
            int pos = rand() % acc_;
            auto it = lower_bound(begin(intervals_), end(intervals_), pos + 1);
            return (--it) - begin(intervals_);
        } else return -1;
    }
private:
    vector<int> intervals_;
    int acc_;
};
```

```Java
class Solution {
    private int[] accumulatedArr;
    private Random rand;
    
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        rand = new Random();
        accumulatedArr = new int[w.length];

        int acc = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length; ++i) {
            acc += w[i];
            accumulatedArr[i] = acc;
        }
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int index = 
            rand.nextInt(accumulatedArr[accumulatedArr.length - 1]) + 1;
        return binarySearchLowerBound(index);
    }
    
    private int binarySearchLowerBound(int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = accumulatedArr.length - 1;
        
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (accumulatedArr[m] == target) {
                return m;
            } else if (accumulatedArr[m] < target) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                r = m;
            }
        }
        
        return l;
    }
}
