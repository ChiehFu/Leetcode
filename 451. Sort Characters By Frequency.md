title: 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:
```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

Example 3:
```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

Thoughts:

**Two Solutions:**
1. Normal sort + self-defined comparator 
   1. Sort the string directly with a self-made comparator where the element are sorted based on :
      1. Their frequency
      2. Their ascii value if the frequencies are same (to satisfy the requirement in Example 2, where the characters having same frequency can't be interleaved, same character must come together)
        ```c++
        class Solution {
        public:
            string frequencySort(string s) {
                vector<int> freq(128, 0);
                for (char c : s) freq[c]++;
                sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&freq] (char &a, char &b) {
                    if (freq[a] == freq[b]) return a < b;
                    else return freq[a] > freq[b];
                });
                return s;
            }
        };
        ```
2. Bucket sort 
   1. Given we are sorting based on a  character frequency, of which the range is restricted to the length of the input string. Thus, for such range we can perform bucket sort/counting sort to sort in `O(N)`.

        ```c++
        //Time:  O(N)
        //Space: O(N)

        class Solution {
        public:
            string frequencySort(string s) {
                vector<int> freq(128, 0);
                for (char c : s) freq[c]++;
                // Use a list of bucket mapping to the frequency 1 ~ s.size()
                vector<vector<char>> bucket(s.size() + 1);
                for (int i = 0; i < freq.size(); i++) {
                    if (freq[i] != 0) {
                        bucket[freq[i]].push_back(i);
                    }
                }
                int w_idx = 0;
                for (int i = bucket.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                    // Iterate over the characters having i frequency 
                    for (int j = 0; j < bucket[i].size(); j++) {
                        // Push a character i times
                        for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {
                            s[w_idx++] = bucket[i][j];
                        }
                    }
                }
                return s;
            }
        };
        ```
