title: 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
tags: Linked List, Easy
notebook: Leetcode

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists: \

begin to intersect at node c1.


Example 1: \
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png) 

```c++
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

Notes:

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Get the length of the two linked lists `l1, l2`
2. Traverse the shorter list from the head, and traverse the longer list from `abs(l2 - l1)th` node, simultaneously.
3. If we meet any node `p, q` such that `p == q`, this will be the intersection of the two lists.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        
        int l1 = 0, l2 = 0;
        
        auto p1 = headA;
        while (p1) {
            p1 = p1->next;
            l1++;
        }
        
        auto p2 = headB;
        while (p2) {
            p2 = p2->next;
            l2++;
        }
        
        // Let headA be the shorter one
        if (l1 > l2) {
            swap(headA, headB);
            swap(l1, l2);
        }
        
        p1 = headA;
        p2 = headB;
        
        // Move p2's starting point bt l2 - l1
        for (int i = 0; i < l2 - l1; i++) p2 = p2->next;
        
        while (p1 && p2) {
            if (p1 == p2) return p1;
            else {
                p1 = p1->next;
                p2 = p2->next;
            }
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};
