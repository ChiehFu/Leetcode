title: 957. Prison Cells After N Days
tags: hash table, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)

Example 1:
```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

Note:

- cells.length == 8
- cells[i] is in {0, 1}
- 1 <= N <= 10^9
----------
Thoughts:
1. Observation:
   1. If the number of days is greater than all possible status, there is going to a cycle.
   2. Find the length of the cycle if there is one, divide N by the length of the cycle and calculate in the end how many days we need to pass to reach the state of the Nth day.

```c++
//Time: < O(N)
//Space:  O(N)

    vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int N) {
        unordered_set<int> prev_cells;
        int cycle = 0;
        bool has_cycle = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            auto next = getNextCell(cells);
            int key = hash(next);
            if (prev_cells.find(key) != prev_cells.end()) {
                // If there is a cycle, we stop at i-1 th day and break the loop, calculate the days left by modulating N by cycle
                has_cycle = true;
                break;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, add the hash key into the set, increase the length of the cycle and set the current cells to next 
                ++cycle;
                prev_cells.insert(key);
                cells = next;
            }
        }
        
        if (has_cycle) {
            for (int i = 0; i < N % cycle; ++i) {
                cells = getNextCell(cells);
            }
        }
        
        return cells;
    }

            next_cells[i] = (cells[i - 1] == 1 && cells[i + 1] == 1 ||
                            cells[i - 1] == 0 && cells[i + 1] == 0);
        }
        return next_cells;
    }
    int hash(vector<int> &cells) {
        int h = 0;
        for (auto n : cells) {
            h = h * 10 + n;
        }
        return h;
