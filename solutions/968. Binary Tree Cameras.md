title: 968. Binary Tree Cameras
tags: Tree, DFS, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:\
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)


```
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```
Example 2:\
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

```
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```
Note:
1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
2. Every node has value 0.

Thoughts:
1. Similar to the question `979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
`, use flow concepts to solve the problem from bottom to up
2. Go from bottom to up and assign the camera to the parent nodes if needed as a parent node can cover totally two children and its parent node.
3. If we are at a leaf, don't set a camera and send a -1 flow to its parent to represent it needs to be covered
4. If there is any negative flow sent from subtree, we have to set up a camera at this position anyway to cover it, if we set a camera, we can cover the upstream node too, so return a +1 positive flow to it.
5. If there is no negative flows from subtrees and have a 1 positive flow, means we can be coverd by subtree and thus don't need a camera. return 0 flow to upstream since we won't cover it too.
6. Check for the flow returned from the root because if there is no request for cover from the subtrees, it won't set a camera to cover itself and request to be covered by its parent which is not exist, so in that case we have to set another one camera for it if we got -1 flow.
