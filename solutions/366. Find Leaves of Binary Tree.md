title: 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
tags: Tree, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

 

Example:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
```

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
```
          1
         / 
        2          
 ```

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
``
          1           
``
3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
```
          []         
```


----------
Thoughts:
1. DFS + Hashset
    1. Do DFS to the tree.
    2. Looping until root has been visited, and push the nodes visited in each iteration into the result.
    3. If all children of a node have been visited, visit the node.
```c++
Time: O(NlogN), logN level -> logN iteration, N nodes
Space: O(N)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        unordered_set<TreeNode*> nodes{nullptr};
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        while (nodes.find(root) == end(nodes)) {
            vector<int> buffer;
            helper(root, nodes, buffer);
            result.emplace_back(buffer);
        }
        return result;
    }
    void helper(TreeNode* root, unordered_set<TreeNode*> &nodes, vector<int> &buffer) {
        if (nodes.find(root) != end(nodes)) return;
        if (nodes.find(root->left) != end(nodes) && nodes.find(root->right) != end(nodes)) {
            nodes.insert(root);
            buffer.emplace_back(root->val);
        } else {
            helper(root->left, nodes, buffer);
            helper(root->right, nodes, buffer);
        }
        return;
    }
};
```

2. DFS + node height
    1. The node having same height (the # of edge from node to the deepest child) will be removed in the same iteration.
    Because the height of the node simply means there are h levels below it needs to be removed before remove it.
    2. The height of a node also represent the final index of the array it will be in the final array.
    1. Solve the question from bottom to up.
    2. Get the height of each node and push it the result array that corresponding to it's height
```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(logN)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        helper(root, result);
        return result;
    }
    int helper(TreeNode* root, vector<vector<int>> &result) {
        if (!root) return -1;
        int l = helper(root->left, result);
        int r = helper(root->right, result);
        int level = max(l, r) + 1;
        if (level == result.size()) result.push_back({});
        result[level].push_back(root->val);
        return level;
    }
};

```
