Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Given the following tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`:

```    
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.
```
Example 2:

Given the following tree `[1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`:
```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
 ```
Return false.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Solve the question from bottom to up
2. Check for the substree strating from each node if they are balance
3. Return depth of the current subtree which will be the depth of its `deepest substree + 1`
4. Use `-1` to represent that there is a unbalanced tree sopted, if get this return value, just stop the process and return it all the way back to the origin call.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return (findUnbalanced(root) != -1);
    }
    int findUnbalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        auto left = findUnbalanced(root->left);
        if (left == -1) return -1;
        
        auto right = findUnbalanced(root->right);
        if (right == -1) return -1;
        
        if (abs(left - right) > 1) return -1;
        else return max(left, right) + 1;
    }
};
```
