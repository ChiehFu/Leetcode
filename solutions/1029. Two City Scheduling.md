title: 1029. Two City Scheduling
tags: Easy, Greedy, Dynamic Programming
notebook: Leetcode
---


There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
``` 

Note:

- 1 <= costs.length <= 100
- It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
- 1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000

----------
Thoughts:
1. This question can be easily solved in a Greedy manner.
   1. Assume that fly everyone to city A at first.
   2. Calculate the cost saved `save` if choose to fly each person to B city instead.
   3. Pick the top `N / 2` persons that save most and fly them to B instead.
   4. Calculate the final cost based on each person's final designated city.


```Java
//Greedy
//Time: O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        int sum = 0;
        List<Integer> bCosts = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; ++i) {
            sum += costs[i][0];
            bCosts.add(costs[i][1] - costs[i][0]);
        }
        
        Collections.sort(bCosts);
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length / 2; ++i) {
            sum += bCosts.get(i);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```
