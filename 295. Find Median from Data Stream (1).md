title: 295. Find Median from Data Stream
tags: heap, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 

Example:

addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
 

Follow up:

If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a `max_pq` and a `min_pq` to store the numbers (and divide the numbers into two halfs) such that the median value will be  `max_pq.top`, or `(max_pq.top() + min_pq.top())/ 2.0`
2. When we want to add a new number, in order to push the number into the heap and maintain the right ordering across two heaps, we perform 2-step process:
   1. Push the value into the `max_pq` first
   2. Push the top of the `max_pq` into the `min_pq`
3. So that we can ensure that the value we pushed into the `min_pq` is greater than all values in the max heap
4. To deal with the even and odd number of the list, we want one heap is alway equal or greater than another, so after pushing the value into the min_pq, pop and push it's top back to the `max_pq` if `min_pq.size() > max_pq.size()`
5. The median value will be `max_pq.top() or (max_pq.top() + min_pq.top())/ 2.0` depending on the length of the list

```c++
class MedianFinder {
public:
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    MedianFinder() {
        
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        // 2-step process to push one element into the min_pq
        // 1. Push the element into the max_pq first
        // 2. Push the top element of max_pq into the min_pq
        max_pq.push(num);
        min_pq.push(max_pq.top());
        max_pq.pop();
        
        // Maintain the related size such that max_pq is always greater or equal to the size of min_pq 
        if (max_pq.size() < min_pq.size()) {
            max_pq.push(min_pq.top());
            min_pq.pop();
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        if (!min_pq.empty() || !max_pq.empty()) {
            if (max_pq.size() > min_pq.size()) {
                return max_pq.top();
            } else {
                return (max_pq.top() + min_pq.top()) / 2.0;
            }
        } return INT_MIN;
    }
private:
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_pq;
    priority_queue<int> max_pq;
};
