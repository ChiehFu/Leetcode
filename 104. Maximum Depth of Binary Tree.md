title: 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
tags: Tree, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Do DFS and solve from bottom to top
2. At each node, finding it's maximum depth from it's subtree and puls 1 as it's maximum, and return for it's parent to use 

```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(logN)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int l = maxDepth(root->left);
        int r = maxDepth(root->right);
        return max(l, r) + 1;
    }
};
```
