Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

```
Example:
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Thoughts:
1. Do DFS in-order traversal
2. At each node:
   - Calculate the longest diameter by combining the longest path from it's two subtrees and update the global ans
   - Return the longest path ended with current node.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int d = 0;
        dfs(root, d);
        return d;
    }
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int &d) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int l = dfs(node->left, d);
        int r = dfs(node->right, d);
        int local = l + r;
        d = max(d, local);
        return max(l, r) + 1;
    }
};
```

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int diameter = 0;
    
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        longestPathPassesRoot(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    
    private int longestPathPassesRoot(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = longestPathPassesRoot(root.left);
        int right = longestPathPassesRoot(root.right);
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, left + right);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
