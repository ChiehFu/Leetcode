title: 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
tags: Linked List, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

Example 1:

![alt](https://discuss.leetcode.com/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png)

```c++
Input:
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
``` 

Note:

- You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.

----------
Thoughts:

2 steps:
1. Traverse the list, make a deep copy of the linked list without random nodes, and store the mapping between old nodes and new nodes
2. Traverse the old and new list simultaneously, use current old node's random node to find the corresponding new random node built previously by the hashmap, link the new current node to that new random node.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _next, Node* _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> m;
        Node *dummy = new Node(0, nullptr, nullptr), *p1 = dummy, *p2 = head;
        while (p2) {
            Node* node = new Node(p2->val, nullptr, nullptr);
            m[p2] = node;
            p1->next = node;
            p1 = p1->next;
            p2 = p2->next;
        }
        
        p1 = dummy->next;
        p2 = head;
        
        while (p2) {
            if (p2->random) {
                p1->random = m[p2->random];
            }
            p1 = p1->next;
            p2 = p2->next;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```
