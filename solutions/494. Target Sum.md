notebook: Leetcode

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```

Note:
- The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
- The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
- Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

Thoughts:
1. Divide the numbers into to set `S1, S2` such that `S = S1 - S2`
2. Observation : 
   1. `sum(nums) = S1 + S2 -> 2 * S1 = sum(nums) - S -> S1 = (sum(nums) - S) / 2`
   2. Given `S1`, `S2` is dependent on `S1`
   3. The problem becomes, given a set of number, find the number of subsets that have the sum equal to `S1`
3. Similar to knapsack problem, solve it by dynamic programming 
4. `dp[i][j] = the # of subsets of the subset nums[0, i] that sum up to j`
5. The first dimension of the `dp` table can be omitted given that each state is solely dependent on the previous one state.


```c++
// Time:  O(N*target)
// Space: O(target)

class Solution {
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int S) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (auto num : nums) sum += num;
        if (sum < S || (sum - S) % 2) return 0;
        int target = (sum - S) / 2;
        
        vector<int> dp(target + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        int acc = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            acc += nums[i];
            for (int j = min(target, acc); j >= nums[i]; --j) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - nums[i]];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
};
