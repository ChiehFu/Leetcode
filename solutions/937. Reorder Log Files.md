title: 937. Reorder Log Files

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:

```c++
Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
```

Note:

- 0 <= logs.length <= 100
- 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
- logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

Thoughts:
1. Use stable sort

```c++
//Time: O(N*NlogN)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
        
        auto comp = [] (const string &a, const string &b) {

            int i1 = a.find_first_of(' ');
            int i2 = b.find_first_of(' ');
            
            if (isdigit(a[i1 + 1])) {
                // Two cases:
                // 1. b is a digit-log
                    // Keep the original a b order, so return false
                // 2. b is a letter-log
                    // Digit goes after letter, so return false

                return false;
            } else {
                if (isdigit(b[i2+ 1])) {
                    // a is a letter-log
                    return true;
                } else {
                    string s1 = a.substr(i1 + 1);
                    string s2 = b.substr(i2 + 1);
            
                    return (s1 != s2)? s1 < s2 : a.substr(0, i1) < b.substr(0, i2);
                }
            }
            
        };
        
        stable_sort(begin(logs), end(logs), comp);
        
        return logs;
    }
};
```
