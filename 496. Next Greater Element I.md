title: 496. Next Greater Element I
tags: Stack, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Note:
- All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
- The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

Thoughts:

The question can be boiled down to two sub tasks:
1. Iterate over the nums2 and use a stack to find out the next greater element for every elements in the stack.
2. Return the next greater element for those elements in the nums1 in the order as they shows in nums1.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_map<int, int> index;
        vector<int> res(nums1.size(), -1);
        
        // Store the mapping between the number in nums1, and it's corresponding index, these are the numbers we want to report the result for
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) index[nums1[i]] = i;
        stack<int> s;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.size(); i++) {
            while (!s.empty() && nums2[i] > s.top()) {
                // Here we pop out every number of which the first greater element is nums2[i]
                int n = s.top(); s.pop();
                // If the number we pop out is in nums1, store nums2[i] as it's answer at the corresponding index in res
                if (index.count(n)) {
                    res[index[n]] = nums2[i];
                }
            }
            s.push(nums2[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
