There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
```
Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```   
```
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```             
Note:

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Represent the courses and the prerequisite relation as a directed graph. 
2. Do dfs topological sort to the graph and see if there is a cycle (If there is, it won't be possible to finish all the courses)
3. Given that the courses are consecutive integers, use a vector to replace a hashmap to speed up.

```c++
//Time: O(n)
//Space: O(n)

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> neighbors(numCourses);
        for (auto &edge : prerequisites) {
            neighbors[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        }
        vector<int> visited(numCourses, 0), on_path(numCourses, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;
            if (dfsCycleDetection(i, neighbors, visited, on_path)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    bool dfsCycleDetection(int cur, vector<vector<int>> &neighbors, vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &on_path) {
        if (on_path[cur]) return true;
        on_path[cur] = true;
        for (auto neighbor : neighbors[cur]) {
            if (dfsCycleDetection(neighbor, neighbors, visited, on_path)) return true;
        }
        visited[cur] = true;
        on_path[cur] = false;
        return false; 
    }
};
```

```Java
//Time: O(n)
//Space: O(n)

class Solution {
    private List<List<Integer>> neighbors;
    
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] isVisited = new boolean[numCourses];
        boolean[] onPath = new boolean[numCourses];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            neighbors.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
            neighbors.get(prerequisite[0]).add(prerequisite[1]); 
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (!isVisited[i] && isGraphCyclic(i, isVisited, onPath)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean isGraphCyclic(int courseNum, boolean[] isVisited, boolean[] onPath) {        
        if (onPath[courseNum]) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (isVisited[courseNum]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        onPath[courseNum] = isVisited[courseNum] = true;
        
        for (int neighbor : neighbors.get(courseNum)) {
