title: 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
tags: Sliding Window, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters `'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'`.

A string is said to be **balanced** if each of its characters appears `n/4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with **any** other string of the same length to make the original string s balanced.

Return `0` if the string is already **balanced**.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER".
``` 
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "QQQQ"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the last 3 'Q' to make s = "QWER".
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s.length is a multiple of 4
- s contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.

```Java

class Solution {

	public int balancedString(String s) {
    	int occurrence = s.length() / 4;
    	int[] count = new int[26];
    	count['Q' - 'A'] = -occurrence;
    	count['W' - 'A'] = -occurrence;
    	count['E' - 'A'] = -occurrence;
    	count['R' - 'A'] = -occurrence;
    	
    	int total = 0;
    	for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
    		if (count[s.charAt(i) - 'A']++ == 0) {
    			total++;
    		}
    	}
        
        if (total == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
    	int l = 0, r = 0;
    	int min = s.length() + 1;
    	
    	while (r < s.length()) {
    		if (count[s.charAt(r++) - 'A']-- == 1) {
    			total--;
    		}
            
    		while (l < r && total == 0) {
    			min = Math.min(min, r - l);
    			
    			if (count[s.charAt(l++) - 'A']++ == 0) {
    				total++;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	
        return min == s.length() + 1? -1:min;
    }
}
```
