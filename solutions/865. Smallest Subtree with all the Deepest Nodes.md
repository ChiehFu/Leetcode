title: 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes
tags: Tree, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree rooted at root, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation:

We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the given tree.
The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node with value 2.
Both the input and output have TreeNode type.
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
- The values of each node are unique.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Recursively traverse the tree and solve the problems for the subtree of children and then solve the subtree rooted as current node based on the sub problems.
2. For each recursion, well return:
   1. The deepest layer.
   2. The node that covers the deepest nodes such that the node is as deep as possible.
3. For each recursion, we will get the return `l, r` for the sub problems of two children:
   1. If `l.depth == r.depth`, current node will become the deepest node to cover the nodes having that depth from two sub trees, return `current node, l.depth + 1`.
   2. If `l.depth > r.depth` or `r.depth > l.depth`, just return the the one that is greater (with an updated depth, if we maintain the depth information aggregating the depth from bottom to top)

        // Increase the depth before return 
        if (left.first > right.first) {
            left.first += 1;
