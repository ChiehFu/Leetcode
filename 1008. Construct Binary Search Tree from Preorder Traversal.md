title: 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
tags: Tree, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `node.left` has a value `< node.val`, and any descendant of node.right has a value `> node.val`.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the `node` first, then traverses `node.left`, then traverses `node.right`.)

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
```

Note: 
1. 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
2. The values of preorder are distinct.
----------
Thoughs:
1. The first element in pre-order will be the root, so pick the first one as a parent node.
2. Devide the ramaining elements into to parts, the elements that are smaller than the parent and the elements that are greater than the parent.
3. Solve these two subcases separately and build the tree connections.

```c++
Time: O(NlongN), in each recursion, it takes linear time to divide the array into two. Totally logN levels of recursion

Space: O(logN)

    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, int left, int right) {
        if (left > right) return nullptr;
        
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(preorder[left]);
        int mid = left + 1;
        while (mid <= right && preorder[mid] < preorder[left]) mid++;
        node->left = buildTree(preorder, left + 1, mid - 1);
        node->right = buildTree(preorder, mid, right);
        
        return node;
    }
};

```
