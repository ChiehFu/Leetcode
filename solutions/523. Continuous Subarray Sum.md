title: 523. Continuous Subarray Sum

notebook: Leetcode

Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
 ```

Note:

- The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
- You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.

Thoughts:
1. To explore `Continuous` subarraies, we can build a accumulative array for input array so that we can efficiently calculate the sum of any subarraies in `O(1)` by looking at the difference between two subarray sums accumulated from index `0`to `i (i > 0)`
2. Solution 1 :
    1. Go through the accumulative array, for each sum i, look for the sum j by which i substracted, will become the multiple of `k`, and make sure the length of this subarray is at least 2
    2. The process above will take O(N) for each sum, and O(N^2) for total calculations 
3. Solution 2:
    1. Instead of storing the sum, we store the modulus of `(sum % k)` and the `index` of the first subarray sum `[0:j]` having this value
    2. If two subarray sums `[0:i], [0:j]` have a same modulus `(sum % k)`, it means by substracting the smaller sum from the bigger sum, the result(subarray between them) `[i+1:j]` will be a multiple of k
    3. For each sum `sum[i]`, we look up if the modulus of `(sum[i] % k)`, showed in the past, if yes, check the length of the subarray

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<int> acc(nums);
        
        // Store the modulus and it's index so that when there is a candidate fit, we can check if the length of the subarray is at least 2
        // Initial the base case {0, -1} to cover the subarray sub[0:i]
        unordered_map<int, int> modulus{{0, -1}};
        for (int i = 0; i < acc.size(); i++)  {
            if (i != 0) acc[i] += acc[i - 1];
            
            // Handle the cases where k = 0
            int target = (k == 0)? acc[i] : acc[i] % k;
            
            if (modulus.find(target) != end(modulus)) {
                if (i - modulus[target] >= 2) return true;
            } else {
                // keep track of the index of a modulus when it shows for the first time
                // we don't need to update this index as we want to have a candidate to form a subarray with at least legth of 2, we store the minimal index to make the length of the subarray formed with this index later as long as possible.
                modulus[target] = i;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
