title: 305. Number of Islands II
tags: Union find, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

A 2d grid map of m rows and n columns is initially filled with water. We may perform an addLand operation which turns the water at position (row, col) into a land. Given a list of positions to operate, count the number of islands after each addLand operation. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
```
Explanation:

Initially, the 2d grid grid is filled with water. (Assume 0 represents water and 1 represents land).
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```
Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land.
```
1 0 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
```
Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land.
```
1 1 0
0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
0 0 0
```
Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land.
```
1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 2
0 0 0
```
Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land.
```
1 1 0
0 0 1   Number of islands = 3
0 1 0
```
Follow up:

- Can you do it in time complexity O(k log mn), where k is the length of the positions?

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use union find to group the adjacent islands.
2. For each island with the coordination `i`, `j`, convert to an unique id `i * n + j`, and use this id for union find process.
3. Count the number of island starting from 0, iterate over the positions and for each position:
   1. If it's a duplicate, jump to last step.
   2. Otherwise
      1. Increase the count by 1
      2. Check if it's neighbors in four direction is a island and check the parent id.
      3. If the parent id are different, mount it's neighbor under the current island id, and decrease the count by 1.
      4. If the parent id are same, they are already in the same group, continue the process. 
   3. Push the count into the vector.
4. As the id of the islands lie in the range `0 - MN`, use vectors to store the necessary information for the island and access by id directly.
