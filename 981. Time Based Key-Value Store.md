Create a timebased key-value store class TimeMap, that supports two operations.

1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp)
   - Stores the key and value, along with the given timestamp.
2. get(string key, int timestamp)

   - Returns a value such that set(key, value, timestamp_prev) was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.
   - If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest timestamp_prev.
   - If there are no values, it returns the empty string ("").

Example 1:
```c++
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","get","get","set","get","get"], inputs = [[],["foo","bar",1],["foo",1],["foo",3],["foo","bar2",4],["foo",4],["foo",5]]
Output: [null,null,"bar","bar",null,"bar2","bar2"]
Explanation:   
TimeMap kv;   
kv.set("foo", "bar", 1); // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1   
kv.get("foo", 1);  // output "bar"   
kv.get("foo", 3); // output "bar" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 ie "bar"   
kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4);   
kv.get("foo", 4); // output "bar2"   
kv.get("foo", 5); //output "bar2"   
```
Example 2:

```c++
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","set","get","get","get","get","get"], inputs = [[],["love","high",10],["love","low",20],["love",5],["love",10],["love",15],["love",20],["love",25]]
Output: [null,null,null,"","high","high","low","low"]
```

Note:

- All key/value strings are lowercase.
- All key/value strings have length in the range [1, 100]
- The timestamps for all TimeMap.set operations are strictly increasing.
- 1 <= timestamp <= 10^7
- TimeMap.set and TimeMap.get functions will be called a total of 120000 times (combined) per test case.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a hashmap to store the mapping from key to a set of pair `<timestamps, value>`.
2. For `set(string key, string value, int timestamp)`, insert the `pair<timestamp, value> into hashmap[key]`
3. For `get(string key, int timestamp)`, perform Binary Search to search the first timestamp that smaller than or equal to the given `timestamp` in `hashmap[key]`

```c++
//Hashmap + Binary Search
//Time:
//1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp):  O(1)
//2. get(string key, int timestamp)              :  O(logN) 

//Space: O(N)

class TimeMap {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TimeMap() {
        
    }
    
    void set(string key, string value, int timestamp) {
        m_[key].push_back({timestamp, value});
    }
    
    string get(string key, int timestamp) {
        auto &timeTable = m_[key];
        // We use pair<int, string> for the timestamp and the mapping value, however, when we do the searching, we don't want the comparator to involve the second element (which shouldn't be used to decide ordering)
        // So here we don't use the default comparator of pair<int, string> given it will compare the second element if the first one are identical
        auto comp = [] (pair<int, string> a, pair<int, string> b) {
            return a.first < b.first;
        };
        // Put timestamp into a pair and do lower_bound search for first element >= timestamp + 1
        // the value goes before the returned position is the target
        auto it = lower_bound(begin(timeTable), end(timeTable), pair<int, string>(timestamp + 1, ""), comp);
        if (it != begin(timeTable)) {
            return (--it)->second;
        } else return "";
    }
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<pair<int, string>>> m_;
