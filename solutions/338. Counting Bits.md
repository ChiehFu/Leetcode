Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers `i` in the range `0 ≤ i ≤ num` calculate the number of `1's` in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```
Follow up:

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time `O(n*sizeof(integer))`. But can you do it in linear time `O(n)` /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be `O(n)`.
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like `__builtin_popcount` in c++ or in any other language.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Simply calculate the number of bits of each current value based on the previous solved value.
2. Use Dynamic Programming technique and we can develop the recursive relationship like the following:
```
dp[0] = 0,
1. dp[n] = dp[n >> 1] + (n & 1) or,
2. dp[n] = dp[n & (n - 1)] + 1, 
For 0 < n <= num

The first equation is to right shifting n to make it a smaller value, which we solved previously). So that we calculate the result as that previous result(+1, if the bit shifted is actually 1)

The second equation is using n & (n - 1) to remove the rightmost 1, which essentially make it become the previous solved value as well. And we use calculate the result as that previous result + 1(for the bit 1 removed previously)
```


```Java
//dp[n] = dp[n >> 1] + (n & 1)
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N

class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        assert num >= 0;
        int[] countByBits = new int[num + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            countByBits[i] = countByBits[i>>1] + (i & 1);
        }
        
        return countByBits;
    }
}
```

```Java
//dp[n] = dp[n & (n - 1)] + 1
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N

class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        assert num >= 0;
        int[] countByBits = new int[num + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            countByBits[i] = countByBits[i & (i - 1)] + 1;
        }
        
        return countByBits;
    }
}
```
