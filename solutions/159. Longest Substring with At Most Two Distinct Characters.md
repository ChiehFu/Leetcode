title: 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
tags: Two Pointers, medium,Sliding Window
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

Thoughts:
1. Two Pointers + Sliding Window, similar to the question [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets)
    1. Store the count of characters in the window
        1. Remove character by increasing the left pointer one by one
        ```c++
        //Time: O(N)
        //Space: O(256)

        class Solution {
        public:
            int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
                vector<int> chars(256, 0);
                int longest = 0;
                int num = 0;
                int begin = 0, end = 0;
                while (end < s.size()) {
                    if (chars[s[end]]++ == 0) num++;
                    while (num > 2) {
                        if (--chars[s[begin]] == 0) num--;
                        begin++;
                    }
                    if (end - begin + 1 > longest) longest = end - begin + 1;
                    end++;
                }
                return longest;
            }
        };
        ```
    2. Store the last index of characters in the window
        1. Remove character by setting the left pointer to the last index of the character that has the smallest last index
        ```c++
        //Time: O(N)
        //Space: O(2)

        class Solution {
        public:
            int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
                unordered_map<char, int> last;
                int l = 0, r = 0;
                int ans = 0;
                while (r < s.size()) {
                    if (!last.count(s[r])) {
                        if (last.size() == 2) {
                            auto it1 = last.begin();
                            auto it2 = it1++;
                            
                            if (it1->second > it2->second) swap(it1, it2);
                            
                            l = it1->second + 1;
                            last.erase(it1);
                        }
                    }
                    last[s[r]] = r;
                    if (r - l + 1 > ans) ans = r - l + 1;
                    r++;
                }
                
                return ans;
            }
        };
                ```
