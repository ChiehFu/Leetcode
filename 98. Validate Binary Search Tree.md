Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 
```Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

```Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

Thought:
1. Parent's value grater than it's left child and smaller than it's right child
2. Do DFS and maintain the left and right boundary value for each node as we go from it's parent
   
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return checkBST(root, nullptr, nullptr);
    }
    bool checkBST(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* minNode, TreeNode* maxNode) {
        if (!node) return true;
        if (minNode && node->val <= minNode->val) return false;
        if (maxNode && node->val >= maxNode->val) return false;
        return checkBST(node->left, minNode, node) && checkBST(node->right, node, maxNode);
    }
};
```
