title: 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
tags: Sliding Window, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- 3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
- s only consists of a, b or c characters.

Thoughts:

Solution 1:
1. Use Sliding Window to find the base substring that satisfies the requirement.
2. Move the leftmost index until the enclosing substring not satisfies the requirement anymore.
3. any index from `0 to leftmost - 1` can be the starting index that satisfies the requirement, add the amount to the result.

```Java
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int[] count = new int[3];
        
        int result = 0;
        int l = 0;
        
        for (int r = 0; r < s.length(); ++r) {
            count[s.charAt(r) - 'a']++;
            while (count[0] > 0 && count[1] > 0 && count[2] > 0) {
                count[s.charAt(l++) - 'a']--;
            }
            result += l;    
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

Solution 2:
1. Let `lastOccurrence` record the last occurrence of letter `a, b, c`.
2. Suppose we've found the last occurrence `i, j, k` index of all three letters
   1. `min(i, j, k) and max(i, j, k)` will be leftmost and rightmost index of that substring that satisfies the requirement. 
   2. Any substring with the index starting from `0 to min(i, j, k)` and  end with `max(i, j, k)` and be the superstring of such substring, so including the substring itself, there are totally `min(i, j, k) + 1` substrings satisfying the requirement.

```Java
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        int[] lastOccurrence = {-1, -1, -1};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        	lastOccurrence[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        	result += 1 + Math.min(
        			Math.min(lastOccurrence[0], lastOccurrence[1]), 
        			lastOccurrence[2]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
