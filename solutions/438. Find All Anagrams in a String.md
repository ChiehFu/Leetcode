title: 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Find out how what character and how many of it do we need to form a anagram of `p`
   1. Scan through `p` and use a vector to store the need for each character in `p`.
2. Use two pointers `l`, `r`, and apply Sliding Window to scan through the string `s`, each time, add the character from the right side and remove the character from the left side of the window based on the following rule, to find window containing exact same characters as `p`.
   1. Each time, when we want to add a character indexed by `r` into the window:
      1. Check if the current window need it
         1. If not, increase index `l` and pop out the character from the left side until we need the current character.
         2. If we've popped out all character but still don't need the current character, this character is not belong to `p`, just move on.
         3. Otherwise, add the character into the window.
   2. If the current window substring has same length as `p`, we've found a anagram of `p` starting from the index `l`. 

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
            vector<int> need(26, 0);
            
            // Use a table to store the number of each character in p.
            for (char c : p) need[c - 'a']++;
            
            vector<int> indices;
            
            for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < s.size(); r++) {
                // When there is no need for the current character, pop out the character from left side until the window needs this character.
                while (l < r && need[s[r] - 'a'] == 0) {
                    need[s[l++] - 'a']++;
                }
                
                // If the need of the current character is still 0 after we poping out every characters from the sliding window, it means this character is not in p at all (not part of the anagram), just move l to the next of r
                if (need[s[r] - 'a'] == 0) {
                    l = r + 1;
                } else { 
                    // Otherwise, add the character into the current window and update the need table.
                    need[s[r] - 'a']--;
                    
                    // If the length of the current substring window is equal to p, we've found a anagram starting from the index l.
                    if (r - l + 1 == p.size()) indices.push_back(l);
                }
