Your are given an array of positive integers nums.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than k.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

Note:

- 0 < nums.length <= 50000.
- 0 < nums[i] < 1000.
- 0 <= k < 10^6.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use Two Pointers to maintain a max-product window and keep track of the product of the elements in the window
2. Every time expand the window by adding a new number on the right, if the product is not smaller than `k`, remove the number from the left side until the product of the window is smaller than `k` again.
3. Each time when we introduce a new subarray of length `l`, there totally are `l` new subarrays, for example:
```
For window (5, 2), when 6 is introduced, it add 3 new subarray: (5, (2, (6)))

        (6)
     (2, 6)
  (5, 2, 6)
```

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int product = 1;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        while (r < nums.size()) {
            product *= nums[r++];
            while (l < r && product >= k) {
                product /= nums[l++];
            }
            ans += r - l;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
