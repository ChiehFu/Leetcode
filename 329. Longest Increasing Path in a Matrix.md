Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the matrix and recursively traverse the matrix from each position to find the longest path.
2. Cache the result that previous solve as we could be visiting the same position later on.
3. In the `1` step, skip those position that has been solved previously.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
            if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
            cache_.assign(matrix.size(), vector<int>(matrix[0].size(), -1));
            int res = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); ++j) {
                    // Skip those position that has been solved 
                    if (cache_[i][j] != -1) continue;
                    res = max(res, dfs(matrix, i, j));
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
        int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int i, int j) {
            // If the position has been solved, return the answer directly
            if (cache_[i][j] != -1) return cache_[i][j];        
            int max_len = 0;
            
            // Explore the four possible directions
            for (auto &d : dirs_) {
                int nxt_i = i + d[0];
                int nxt_j = j + d[1];
                if (nxt_i < 0 || nxt_i >= matrix.size() || nxt_j < 0 || nxt_j >= matrix[0].size()) continue;
                if (matrix[i][j] >= matrix[nxt_i][nxt_j]) continue;
                // Call the recursion to solve the sub case if the value of the next position is greater than the current 
                max_len = max(max_len, dfs(matrix, nxt_i, nxt_j));
            }
            return cache_[i][j] = max_len + 1;
        }
    private:
        vector<vector<int>> cache_;
        vector<vector<int>> dirs_ = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    };
    ```
