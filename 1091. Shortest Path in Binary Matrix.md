title: 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
tags: BFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).

A clear path from top-left to bottom-right has length k if and only if it is composed of cells C_1, C_2, ..., C_k such that:

Adjacent cells C_i and C_{i+1} are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)
C_1 is at location (0, 0) (ie. has value grid[0][0])
C_k is at location (N-1, N-1) (ie. has value grid[N-1][N-1])
If C_i is located at (r, c), then grid[r][c] is empty (ie. grid[r][c] == 0).
Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Imagine this 2D matrix as a graph, where the vertexes of the graph are those positions `(i, j)` in the 2D matrix having the value `0`.
2. The neighbors of each vertex `(i, j)` of the graph will be the adjacent neighbors in eight directions of the positions `(i, j)` in the 2D matrix. 
3. The task becomes finding the shortest path from the vertex `(0, 0)` to the vertex `(N - 1, N - 1)`, use BFS to find the shortest path.

    ```c++
    // Time : O(N * N)
    // Space: O(N * N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int N = grid.size();
            if (grid[0][0] || grid[N - 1][N - 1]) return -1;
            
            vector<vector<int>> visited(N, vector<int>(N, 0));
            queue<pair<int, int>> q;
            
            q.push({0, 0});
            visited[0][0] = 1;
            
            int k = 1;
            
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int size = q.size();
                while (size--) {
                    auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                    int row = cur.first;
                    int col = cur.second;
                    
                    if (row == N - 1 && col == N - 1) return k;
                    
                    for (int i = -1; i <= 1; ++i) {
                        for (int j = -1; j <= 1; ++j) {
                            
                            if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue;
                            int nxt_row = row + i;
                            int nxt_col = col + j;
                            
                            if (nxt_row < 0 || nxt_row >= N || nxt_col < 0 || nxt_col >= N) continue;
                            if (grid[nxt_row][nxt_col] || visited[nxt_row][nxt_col]) continue;
                            visited[nxt_row][nxt_col] = 1;
                            q.push({nxt_row, nxt_col});
                        }
                    }
                }
