Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```


Constraints:

- 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
- 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

----------

Thoughts:
1. Let `dp[i][j]` be the longest common subsequence of the subsequences `text1[0, i]` and `text2[0, j]`
2. We can notice the relation between current problem and sub-problems as follow: 
    ```
    For dp[i + 1][j + 1]:
        If text1[i + 1] == text2[j + 1]
            dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + 1
        Else 
            dp[i + 1][j + 1] = max(dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j])
    ```
3. For a given state, the result is dependent of the previous state and the preceding result in the current state, we can optimize and reduce the DP table from 2D array to 1D.

```Java
// 2D DP with extra padding for handling boundary more consistently
// Time: O(MN)
// Space: O((M + 1) * (N + 1))

class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
    	int m = text1.length();
    	int n = text2.length();
    	int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
    	for (int i = 0; i < m + 1; ++i) {
    		dp[m] = new int[n + 1];
    	}
    	for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    		for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
    			if (text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)) {
    				dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + 1;
    			} else {
    				dp[i + 1][j + 1] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

```Java 
// 1D DP with space optimized
// Time: O(MN)
// Space: O(min(M, N))

class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        if (text1.length() < text2.length()) {
            return longestCommonSubsequence(text2, text1);
        }
    	int m = text1.length();
    	int n = text2.length();
    	int[] dp = new int[n];
    	
    	for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    		int[] tmp = new int[n];
    		tmp[0] = text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(0)? 1 : dp[0];
    		for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
    			if (text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)) {
    				tmp[j] = dp[j - 1] + 1;
    			} else {
    				tmp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], tmp[j - 1]);
    			}
    		}
    		dp = tmp;
    	}
    	return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```
