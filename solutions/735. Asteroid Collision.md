title: 735. Asteroid Collision
tags: Stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: 
The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
asteroids = [8, -8]
Output: []
Explanation: 
The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 
asteroids = [10, 2, -5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: 
The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5.  The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: 
asteroids = [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Output: [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Explanation: 
The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right.
Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.
```
Note:

- The length of asteroids will be at most 10000.
- Each asteroid will be a non-zero integer in the range [-1000, 1000]..

Thoughts:
1. For every asteroid going left, we check if there is any asteroid going right on it's left side, if so, complete them against each other and explode any or both of them according to the rules.
2. Use a vector to simulate the stack as we need to return a stack containing all asteroids survived in the end.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        vector<int> s; // Use a vector to simulate the stack, so that at the end we don't have to put all elements back to a vector and reverse the vector.

        for (int i = 0; i < asteroids.size(); i++) {
            if (asteroids[i] < 0) {
                while (!s.empty() && s.back() > 0 && abs(s.back()) < abs(asteroids[i])) s.pop_back();
                // After the while loop, 3 conditions:
                // 1. The asteroid on the top of the stack is going left (not gonna collide with the current one) -> push the current one into the stack
                // 2. The asteroid on the top of the stack is going right, and is as big as the current one -> pop the one on the stack
                // 3. The asteroid on the top of the stack is going right, and is greater than the current one -> do nothing
                // 4. There is no more asteroid in the stack -> push the current one into the stack
                
                // Condition 1 and 4
                if (s.empty() || s.back() < 0) s.push_back(asteroids[i]);
                // Condition 2
                else if (abs(s.back()) == abs(asteroids[i])) s.pop_back();
                // Do nothing for condition 3
            } else {
                s.push_back(asteroids[i]);
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
