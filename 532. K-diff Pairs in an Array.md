Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1, 3, 1, 5, 4], k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).
```
Note:
- The pairs (i, j) and (j, i) count as the same pair.
- The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
- All the integers in the given input belong to the range: [-1e7, 1e7].

----------
Thoughts:
1. Since the question ask for **unique pair**, first, use a hashmap to count the number of appearances of each number in the array.
2. Iterate over the number in the hashmap, for each unique number `i`:
   1. if `k == 0 && count[i]`, difference is 0, so any values appearing more than one can used to make a pair.
   2. or `k > 0 && (i + k) is in the hashmap`, if the value `i + k` is also in the hashmap, (i, i + k) can form a pair.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int findPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k < 0) return 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) m[nums[i]]++;
        int ans = 0;
        for (auto it : m) {
            if (k == 0) {
                if (it.second >= 2) ans++;
            } else {
                if (m.count(it.first + k)) ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
