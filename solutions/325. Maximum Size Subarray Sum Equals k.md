title: 325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k
tags: hash table, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Note:
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.

```

Example 2:

----------
Thoughts:
1. Given the elements in the array are not all positive or negative, which means the sum is not consistently ascending/descending, we can't use Slide Window to solve the problem.
2. Build a accumulative array `acc`, where `acc[i]` = `the prefix sum of arr from 0 to i`.
3. If two prefix sum `acc[j] - acc[i] == k`, we can know the sum of the sub array `arr[i + 1, j]` is `k`, and the length of this sub array is `j - i`.
4. With the accumulative array `acc`, the problem can be simplified to find two values in `acc` having the difference `k`, and from all possible pairs, we find the one having longest distance.
5. Solve it like solving a two sum problem, where we use a hash table to store the number we've seen, for a new number, we search it's complement number in the hashmap(with the index).

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArrayLen(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Store the pair {prefix sum, index}
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        // Add the pair {0, -1} as the base case to consider the sub array starting from 0. 
        m[0] = -1;
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> acc(nums);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < acc.size(); i++) {
            // Calculate the accumulative array
            if (i > 0) acc[i] += acc[i - 1];
            int target = acc[i] - k;
            // Search the target in the hash table for the index, and calculate the length of the sub array
            if (m.count(target)) ans = max(ans, i - m[target]);

            // Store the index for a prefix sum only for the first time, since we want to find the longest sub array 
            if (!m.count(acc[i])) m[acc[i]] = i;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
