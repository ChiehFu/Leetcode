title: 316. Remove Duplicate Letters
tags: Stack, Greedy, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

Example 1:
```
Input: "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. We need to remove the characters from the string such that every character in the result string are unique and the string is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible.
2. Remove character from string making a smallest string in lexicographical order is kind of similar to the question [402. Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits), where we use a stack and remove the on on the top of the stack if we meet something smaller.
3. For this question, we got more rules on removing characters (not simply remove when possible).
   1. For a character `A` showing `n` times in the string, we can only remove it `n - 1` times.
   2. If a character `A` has been put into the stack and hasn't been removed since then, when we meet `A` as we traverse the later part of the string, we just omit it, as we already use this character in our final answer.
   3. When we meet a character `B` that is smaller than the `A` on the top of the stack, 
      1. We  have to make sure that `A` is removable:
      2. How is a character removable?
         1. If this is not the last presentence of `A` in the string, meaning that if we remove it right here, later we might have a chance to add it back to the final answer (which is required to satisfy the question).
         2. If it's the last time it presents, even thought `B` can replace `A`, we need to keep this last `A` right here.
4. Count the number of time the characters show in the original string, so that when we iterate over the string, we can know if we will meet the same character later, for step `3.ii, 3.iii`.
5. Use a `used` table, to keep track of the character that has been used in the final answer (ketp in the stack) for step `3.i`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(26) -> O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicateLetters(string s) {
        vector<int> counts(26, 0), used(26, 0);
        for (auto c : s) counts[c - 'a']++;
        stack<char> stack;
        for (auto c : s) {
            // Every time past a character, update the number of it left in the remaining part of the input string
            counts[c - 'a']--;
            // If current character has been used in the stack, we don't consider for this one (it's not valid and should be removed directly)
            if (used[c - 'a']) continue;
            
            // When current character is smaller than the one on the top of the stack, and the one on the top is removable,
            // Pop it out and update the used table to false for it
            while (!stack.empty() && c < stack.top() && counts[stack.top() - 'a'] > 0) {
                used[stack.top() - 'a'] = false;
                stack.pop();
            }
            // Push current char into the stack and update the used table to true for it
            used[c - 'a'] = true;
            stack.push(c);
        }
        // Pop out the chars to a string, and reverse the string
        string res = "";
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            res += stack.top();
            stack.pop();
        }
        reverse(begin(res), end(res));
        return res;
    }
};
