Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
```
Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”
Output: 1
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
Output: 3
```
Note:
- You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.

Thoughts:
1. Same concept as the question [243. Shortest Word Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/)
2. Two pointer with `O(N)` space solution
3. `O(1)` space solution
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
            int dst = words.size();
            int index = -1;
            // Use a boolean variable so that we don't repeatedly spend O(N) to compare them in the for loop
            bool same = (word1 == word2);
            for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
                if (words[i] == word1 || words[i] == word2) {
                    if (index != -1 && (same || words[i] != words[index])) {
                        dst = min(dst, i - index);
                    }
                    index = i;
                }
            }
            return dst;
        }
    };
    ```
