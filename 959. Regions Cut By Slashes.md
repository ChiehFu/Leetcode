title: 959. Regions Cut By Slashes
tags: DFS, Union find, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 2:
```
Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1

Note:

- 1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
- grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.

Thoughts:

Solution 1:
  1. For each cell in the original grid, represent it as a 3 by 3 grid with the slash denoted as value `0` and blanks denoted as `0`.
      ```
              100           001           000
      "\\" -> 010    "/" -> 010    " " -> 000
              001           100           000
      ```
  2. After building up the grid for the original `N x N` grid, the regions will be those `0`s enclosed by `1`s, the problem essential becomes [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/), which can be solved with DFS of Union Find.

        ```Java

                        int len = grid.length * 3;
                        int[][] board = new int[len][len];
                        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
                            board[i] = new int[len];
                        }
