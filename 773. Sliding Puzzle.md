title: 773. Sliding Puzzle
tags: BFS, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

Examples:
```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14
```
Note:

- board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
- board[i][j] will be a permutation of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

----------
Thoughts:
1. To find the minimal swap, we need to use BFS to explore all possible combination of swap operation starting from given state. 
2. Each board represent a state, and for each board, we swap the zero with it's neighbor in four directions on the board to find the neighbors of the current state.
3. The board itself is a 2D vector, not like a single value which can be compared directly, so we need to find out some way to 'hash' the board to some key such that each unique board has an unique key which is comparable.
   1. We can flatten the 2D board to 1D and use a string to represent it.
        ```
        For example, a 2D board {{0,1,2}, {3,4,5}} can be flatten to a string "012345".
        ```
   2. After flatten the board, we lose the 2D axis which is required to identify the neighbors in 4 directions for a given position on the board.
   3. For that matter, we can pre-build a hash table, where we map an index of 1D string to it's corresponding neighbors in 1D string, and we can later swap the zero in the string to those positions in 1D string corresponding to it's neighbors in the original 2D board.
   4. Also, for each state, we can keep it's flattened string with the 2D axis of the zero on original 2D board.
      1. Use the axis to find four direction on 2D board.
      2. Convert both the 2D axis of zero and it's neighbors to 1D and swap the elements of the string accordingly.


```c++
//Flatten the board to 1D string and pre-build the neighbor table for 1D coordination according to the 2D coordination.
//Time:  O(6!), we at most explore all possible permutation during the BFS which is 6!
//Space: O(6!), we only push those unseen state into the queue, and there are totally 6! of them.
