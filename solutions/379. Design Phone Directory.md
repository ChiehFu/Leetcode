title: 379. Design Phone Directory

Design a Phone Directory which supports the following operations:

`get`: Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
`check`: Check if a number is available or not.
`release`: Recycle or release a number.

Example:

```c++
// Init a phone directory containing a total of 3 numbers: 0, 1, and 2.
PhoneDirectory directory = new PhoneDirectory(3);

// It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
directory.get();

// Assume it returns 1.
directory.get();

// The number 2 is available, so return true.
directory.check(2);

// It returns 2, the only number that is left.
directory.get();

// The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
directory.check(2);

// Release number 2 back to the pool.
directory.release(2);

// Number 2 is available again, return true.
directory.check(2);

```

Thoughts:

**Solution 1:**
1. Add all numbers within the range into a hashmap:
    1. Remove the number allocated, and add number released again.
    2. Look up the hashmap to see if a number has been used or not.
2. Adding every number into a hashmap in the first step takes time `O(N)`.

**Solution 2:**
1. Sequentially allocated the number form `0` to `max_number - 1`
2. Use a hashmap to store the number has been allocated, so that we can check if a number has been allocated in time `O(1)`
3. Use a queue to store the number has been released, so that next time when we need to allocate a number, check if there are number available in the queue before sequentially take a new number in step 1.
4. The consistency between the queue and hash table is important, when there is a request for releasing a number, check the validity of the number. 

```c++
//Time:  O(1) for all operations
//Space: O(N)

class PhoneDirectory {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here
        @param maxNumbers - The maximum numbers that can be stored in the phone directory. */
    PhoneDirectory(int maxNumbers) {
        max_ = maxNumbers;
        next_ = 0;
    }
    
    /** Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
        @return - Return an available number. Return -1 if none is available. */
    int get() {
        // When allocating a number, consider:
        // 1. Any used number in the queue that was been released/recycled
        // 2. The new number next_ if it's smaller than max 
        if (!free_.empty()) {
            int n = free_.front(); free_.pop();
            used_.insert(n);
            return n;
        } else if (next_ < max_) {
            used_.insert(next_);
            return next_++;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    /** Check if a number is available or not. */
    bool check(int number) {
        return used_.count(number) == 0;
    }
    
    /** Recycle or release a number. */
    void release(int number) {
        // Check if the number is valid (actually has been allocated previously)
        if (check(number)) return;
        used_.erase(number);
        free_.push(number);
    }
private:
    unordered_set<int> used_;
    queue<int> free_;
    int next_;
    int max_;
};

/**
 * Your PhoneDirectory object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * PhoneDirectory* obj = new PhoneDirectory(maxNumbers);
 * int param_1 = obj->get();
 * bool param_2 = obj->check(number);
 * obj->release(number);
 */
```
