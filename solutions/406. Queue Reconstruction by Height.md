title: 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
tags: Greedy, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
``` 
----------
Thoughts:
1. pick the tallest group of people and sort them base on `k` as a subarray. Because there is no other group taller than them, each person's second value will be exactly his position in this subarray.
2. Pick the second tall group of people and insert them into the previous subarray at the position `k` sequentially, perform this process for the rest of the group.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {

        // sort the array based on:
        // 1. h (descending)
        // 2. k (ascending), for pairs with same h, the one with smaller k should be inserted into the array before the one with greater k, given k counts for greater than and equal to.  
        Arrays.sort(people, (p, q) -> {
            if (p[0] == q[0]) {
                return Integer.compare(p[1], q[1]);
            } else {
                return Integer.compare(q[0], p[0]);
            }
        });
        
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] p : people) {
            result.add(p[1], p);
        }
        
        return result.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
    }
}
```
