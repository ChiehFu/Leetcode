Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
 ```

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a vector to store the common characters with the minimal frequency among all strings.
2. Iterate over the strings and count the frequency of the characters of the string.
3. For each word update the count of characters to the global vector to maintain the minimal count for the common characters.
4. Build the return string based on the character and it's frequency.
5. To convert a char `'c'` to a string `"c"`, use `string(1, c)`.
```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& A) {
        vector<int> v(26, INT_MAX);
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
            vector<int> tmp(26, 0);
            for (auto &c : A[i]) {
                tmp[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                v[i] = min(v[i], tmp[i]);
            }
        }
        
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < v[i]; j++) {
                res.emplace_back(string(1, ('a' + i)));
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
