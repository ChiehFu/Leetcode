Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.

Example:
```c++
Input:
A = [ 1, 2]
B = [-2,-1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [ 0, 2]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] = 0` is equal to find tuples satisfying such that `A[i] + B[j] == -(C[k] + D[l])`
2. Take the array `A and B`, compute all the possible sum of two elements.
3. Put the sum and the number of times it shows into a hashmap.
3. Take the array `C and D`, compute all the possible sum of two elements.
    1. For each sum, if the hashmap has the opposite value of the current sum, add the corresponding frequency into the count of four elements sum to 0.

```c++
//Time: O(N^2)
//Space: O(N^2)

class Solution {
public:
    int fourSumCount(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B, vector<int>& C, vector<int>& D) {
        unordered_map<int, int> sumA;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int a : A) {
            for (int b : B) {
                sumA[a + b]++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int c : C) {
            for (int d : D) {
                auto it = sumA.find(-(c + d));
                if (it != end(sumA)) {
                    ans += sumA[-(c + d)];
                }
            }
        }    
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
