title: 249. Group Shifted Strings
tags: String, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:

"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

Example:
```
Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
Output: 
[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. For each string, normalize the characters of the string with respect to the first character of the string.
2. For any character out of boundary after normalization, offset it by `26` to handle the character series crossing from `z to a`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupStrings(vector<string>& strings) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> group;
        for (auto &s : strings) {
            string tmp = s;
            int offset = s[0] - 'a';
            for (int j = 0; j < tmp.size(); ++j) {
                tmp[j] = tmp[j] - offset;
                if (tmp[j] < 'a') tmp[j] = tmp[j] + 26;
            }
            group[tmp].push_back(s);
        }
        vector<vector<string>> res;
        for (auto &g : group) res.push_back(g.second);
        return res;
    }
};
```
