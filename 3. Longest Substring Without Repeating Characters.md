Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:
```c++
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window of substring which contains non-repeating characters.
2. Each time, increase the right pointer by one to add new character into the window:
    1. Before add the character, check if that character exists in the current window, if so, increase the left pointer to remove character sequentially until the target has been removed
3. Keep track of the longest substring we found
4. Step 2 can be further optimized:
    1. For each character, we store the index next to it's position in the string. When we want to remove that character out of window, we don't need to do that sequentially, but just to set the left pointer `left = max(left, next[c])`. 
    2. In `left = max(left, next[c])` we use `max` to make sure the next position is still valid, i.e., lies in the current window.
5. We can use vector to store the characters represented by ASCII code.


```c++
//Hash map
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_set<char> chars;
        while (r < s.size()) {
            while (l < r && chars.count(s[r])) {
                chars.erase(s[l++]);
            }
            chars.insert(s[r]);
            ans = max(ans, r - l  + 1);
            r++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

```c++
//Optimized with vector
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(128)

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> next(128, 0);
        while (r < s.size()) {
            l = max(l, next[s[r]]);
            ans = max(ans, r - l  + 1);
            next[s[r]] = r + 1;
            r++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
