title: 45. Jump Game II
tags: hard, Greedy
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:

Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

Thoughts:
1. Similar to the idea in question [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
2. Besides, we use the variable `cur_reach` to represent the how far we can get by the previous jump, and use `max_reach` to represent the farthest position we can get when making jump from the previous position.
3. Do this in a greedy fashion, each time, we only jump when it's necessary, and when we jump, we pick the jump (from previous position) that can get us as far as possible, and count the total number of time we jump. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_reach = 0;
        int able_reach = 0;
        int jmp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // When our previous jump can't reach the current position, make a farthest jump from previous position (which is kept in the variable max_reach)
            if (i > able_reach) {
                able_reach = max_reach;
                ++jmp;
            }
            // Update the farthest position we can reach by jumping from the position we pass.
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i]);
        }
        return jmp;
    }
};
```
