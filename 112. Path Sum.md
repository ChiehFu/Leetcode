Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Recursively traverse the tree and accumulate the sum from root to current node.
2. If sum equals to K and current node is a leaf, return true
3. If the path has been found in left subtree, stoping going to right subtree and return `ture` directly. 

```C++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(logN)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        return helper(root, sum);
    }
    bool helper(TreeNode* root, int &remains) {
        if (!root) return false;
        remains -= root->val;
        if (remains == 0 && !root->left && !root->right) return true;
        if (helper(root->left, remains) || helper(root->right, remains)) return true;
        remains += root->val;
        return false;
    }
};
```
