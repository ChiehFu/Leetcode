You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
``` 

Note:

You can assume that

- 0 <= amount <= 5000
- 1 <= coin <= 5000
- the number of coins is less than 500
- the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

----------
Thoughts:
1. We are finding total number of combinations of a set of coins that make up to a target amount, and seem the greater amount can be made from a smaller amount plus some coins, this give an intuition that we can solve this problem with dynamic programming technique.
2. Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of combinations of the set of coins `coins[0:i]` that we can use to make up the amount `j`.
3. Notice here, we are allowed to use the same coin for multiple times, so the relation between previous smaller problem and current greater problem can be defined as `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - coin[i]]`, where `dp[i - 1][j]` is the number of ways we can make amount `j` with the coin set `coins[0:i-1]` (i.e. don't consider using `coin ith`) and `dp[i][j - coins[i]]` is the number of ways we can make amount `j - coin[i]` (i.e. consider using `coin ith` for at least once).

4. Bottom-up dp solution:
    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
            if (amount == 0 || coins.empty()) return amount == 0? 1 : 0;
            vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
            dp[0] = 1;
            
            //dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - coin]
            
            for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); ++i) {
                for (int j = 1; j <= amount; ++j) {
                    if (j >= coins[i]) {
                        dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
                    }
                }
            }
            
            return dp[amount];
        }
    };
    ```
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
            if (amount == 0 || coins.length == 0) {
                return amount == 0? 1 : 0;
            }
            
            int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
            dp[0] = 1;
            
            for (int coin : coins) {    

                // Set i to start from coin, pruning for the calculation for those i < coin
                for (int i = coin; i <= amount; ++i) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
                }
            }
            
            return dp[amount];
        }
    }

    ```
5. Top-down recursive solution:
    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
            if (amount == 0) return 1;
            if (coins.empty()) return 0;
            cache.assign(coins.size(), vector<int> (amount + 1, -1));
            
            return dfs(amount, coins, 0);
        }
        int dfs(int amount, vector<int>& coins, int index) {
            if (amount == 0) return 1;
            if (cache[index][amount] != -1) return cache[index][amount];
            int sum = 0;
            
            for (int i = index; i < coins.size(); ++i) {
                if (amount >= coins[i]) {
                    sum += dfs(amount - coins[i], coins, i);
                }
            }
            
            return cache[index][amount] = sum;
        }
    private:
        vector<vector<int>> cache;
    };
    ```
