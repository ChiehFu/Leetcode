title: 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
tags: Tree, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Pick the middle element of the array as the current node, and divide the array into to part to build the left and right subtrees

```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(logN)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        return buildTree(nums, 0, (int)nums.size() - 1);
    }
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int> &nums, int l, int r) {
        if (l > r) return nullptr;
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        node->left = buildTree(nums, l, mid - 1);
        node->right = buildTree(nums, mid + 1, r);
        return node;
    }
};
```
