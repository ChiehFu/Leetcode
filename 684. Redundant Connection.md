In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair `[u, v]` with `u < v`, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with `u < v`.
```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```
```
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```    
Note:
- The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
- Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate through the edges and union the nodes of the edge by mounting the parent of one of the node to the parent of another node.
2. If the nodes have the same parent before mounting for this edge, there is a cycle, and the current edge is redundant. 
3. Union for the edges from left to right so that the invalid edge will be the one that occurs last among all of the possible answers. 

```c++
//Union find
//Time: O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        parents_.assign(edges.size() + 1, -1);
        for (auto &edge : edges) {
            int parentU = findParent(edge[0]);
            int parentV = findParent(edge[1]);
            if (parentU == parentV) {
                return edge;
            } else {
                parents_[parentU] = parentV;
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
    int findParent(int v) {
        if (parents_[v] == -1) return parents_[v] = v;
        return (parents_[v] == v)? v : parents_[v] = findParent(parents_[v]);
    }
private:
    vector<int> parents_;
};
```
