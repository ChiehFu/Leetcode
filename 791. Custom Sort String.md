title: 791. Custom Sort String
tags: String, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.

S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
```
Example :
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

Note:

- S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
- T has length at most 200.
- S and T consist of lowercase letters only.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Sort the string based on some rules.
2. For the characters in `S`, use a hash map to map the character to it's index in `S`, this `index` describe the relations between those characters.
3. For the rest of the characters not showing in `S`, we can just store a uniform value for them in the map, because all we care about is having the characters in `S` sorted based on their index in `S`.
4. Implement a comparator, where we compare the relations between the characters in `S` based on their index from the hash map.

```c++
//Time:  O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string S, string T) {
        vector<int> ordering(26, S.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            ordering[S[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        sort(T.begin(), T.end(), [&ordering](char &a, char &b) {
            return ordering[a - 'a'] < ordering[b - 'a'];
        });
        return T;
    }
};
```
