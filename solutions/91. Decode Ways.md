title: 91. Decode Ways
tags: Dynamic Programming, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:
```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        // Use dp[i] to store the number of decode ways for a string s[0, i - 1]
        // Set dp[0] = 1 for base case 
        vector<int> dp(s.size() + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            // If current character s[i] can be decoded as a alphabet, the total number of ways will depend on the total number of ways of the string before this character s[0, i - 1]
            int ways = (s[i] > '0')? dp[i] : 0;
            
            // If there is a prior character that is not 0
            if (i > 0 && s[i - 1] != '0') {
                int num = stoi(s.substr(i - 1, 2));
                // If current and previous characters s[i-1, i] can form a number that can be decoded as a alphabet, the total number of ways will depend on the number of ways of the string before this two characters s[0, i - 2]
                if (num <= 26) {
                    ways += dp[i - 1];
                }
            }
            dp[i + 1] = ways;
        }
        return dp[s.size()];
    }
};
