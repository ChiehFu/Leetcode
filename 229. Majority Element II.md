title: 229. Majority Element II
tags: Array, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
----------

Thoughts:
1. This question is very much similar to the question [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/), which can be solved by the concept of Majority Vote in linear time and constant space.
2. The difference lies in the fact that there could be `0 ~ 2` candidates showing up more than `n / 3` times.
3. So we scan through the array to find the two candidates that survive the voting process, and scan through the array again to count the actual occurrence of each candidate, in the end, we return those qualified. 

```Java
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        
        // Two candidates take two different random numbers to start
        int candidate1 = 0;
        int candidate2 = 1;
        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;
        
        for (int n : nums) {
        	if (n == candidate1) {
        		++count1;
        	} else if (n == candidate2) {
        		++count2;
        	} else if (count1 == 0) {
        		count1 = 1;
        		candidate1 = n;
        	} else if (count2 == 0) {
        		count2 = 1;
        		candidate2 = n;
        	} else {
        		--count1;
        		--count2;
        	}
        }
        
        count1 = count2 = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
        	if (n == candidate1) {
        		++count1;
        	} else if (n == candidate2) {
        		++count2;
        	}
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (count1 > nums.length / 3) {
        	result.add(candidate1);
        }
        
        if (count2 > nums.length / 3) {
        	result.add(candidate2);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
