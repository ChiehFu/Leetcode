title: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
tags: Tree, Binary Search
notebook: Leetcode
---
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?


----------
Thoughts:
1. Do in-order traversal and decrease k by one each time.
2. When `k == 0` return current node.

```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(logN)
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        if (!root) return -1;
        return countNodes(root, k)->val;
    }
    TreeNode* countNodes(TreeNode* node, int &k) {
        if (!node) return nullptr;
        auto l = countNodes(node->left, k);
        if (l) return l;
        if (--k == 0) return node;
        return countNodes(node->right, k);
    }
};
```

Follow-up:
- If this function will be repeatedly called, we can maintain a variable `count` for each node, which is the total number of nodes in it's left subtree (smaller than current node). 
- When inserting or deleting nodes, `count` can be maintained and updated at the same time.
- Say `count = k` for current node, the current node will be the `k+1`th large value of total values in ascending order.
- Do binary search for the target value k and compare with `count` to decide whether return of keep searching left or right subtree. 
- Use AVL tree or Fenwick tree to maintain `O(logN)` operations time
```
