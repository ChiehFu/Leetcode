Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in A.

Recall that a subsequence of A is a list A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k] with 0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1, and that a sequence B is arithmetic if B[i+1] - B[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < B.length - 1).

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
```

Note:

- 2 <= A.length <= 2000
- 0 <= A[i] <= 10000

----------
Thoughts:
1. Maintain a dp array `len`, where `len[i]` is a set of pairs `pair<int diff, int len>` which represents that there is an arithmetic sequence of length `len` with the arithmetic difference `diff` that ends with `A[i]`.
    ```
    For example:
    len[i] = {{4,1}}
    Means that there is a sequence of length `1` with arithmetic difference `4` that ends with the number A[i].
    ```
2. Suppose there are two numbers `A[i], A[j]` and their difference is `k`, the length of the sequence of arithmetic difference `k` that ends with `A[j]` will be the sequence of arithmetic difference `k` that ends with `A[i]` + `1`.
3. Based on the relation above, we can solve the current problem based on the previous problem.
4. Use `i` to loop over `A` from `1 to n - 1`, and for each `i`, use `j` to loop over `0 to i - 1` to get the pair `A[j] and A[i]`
   1. For every pair `A[j] and A[i]`, find the difference `k` and compute the length of the sequence with arithmetic with `k` that ends with `A[i]` based on the result from `A[j]`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N^2)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& A) {
        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> length(A.size());
        int longest_len = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = A[i] - A[j];
                // If there is no sequence with diff that ends with A[j], A[j] will be the first element of the sequence, so the length of the sequence with A[i] added will be 2
                // Otherwise, the length will be the length of the sequence with diff that ends with A[j] + 1
                length[i][diff] = (!length[j].count(diff))? 2 : length[j][diff] + 1;
                longest_len = max(longest_len, length[i][diff]);    
            }
        }
        return longest_len;
    }
};
