title: 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
tags: Graph, DFS, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
```
Example 1:

Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```
```
Example 2:

Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Think of the locations as vertices in a graph, and each itinerary from A to B represents a directed edge from A to B in the graph.
2. Store the relations between vertices in a hashmap which maps the a vertex to a container (heap/set) that stores all it's neighbor in lexical order. O(n + nlogn)
3. Find a **Eulerian path** for this graph starting from "JFK" as the question required.
    1. Brute force:
       1. Try all possible itinerary combination and return the one that valid
       2. O(n!) time for all possible combination.
    2. [Hierholzer's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hierholzers-algorithm-directed-graph/)
       1. Post-order traverse the graph from starting point.
       2. Use stack to handle the traversal order.
       3. O(N) time.

```c++
//Solve by Hierholzer's algorithm
//Time: O(n + nlogn + n), build map(sort) + dfs traversal 
//Space: O(n + logn), edge map + recursion stack 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        buildGraph(tickets);
        stack<string> s;
        // start from "JFK"
        dfs("JFK", s);
        vector<string> res;
        // pop out the stack to reverse the traversal order 
        while (!s.empty()) {
            res.push_back(s.top());
            s.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
    void buildGraph(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        for (const auto &ticket : tickets) {
            edges_[ticket[0]].push(ticket[1]);
        }
    }
    void dfs(string cur, stack<string> &s) {

        // Visit all neighbors of the current vertex
        while (!edges_[cur].empty()) {
            string next = edges_[cur].top();
            edges_[cur].pop();
            dfs(next, s);
        }
        // push the current into the result stack 
        s.push(cur);
    }
private:
    // use a hashmap with min-heap(max-heap by defalut)
    unordered_map<string, priority_queue<string, vector<string>, greater<string>>> edges_;
};
