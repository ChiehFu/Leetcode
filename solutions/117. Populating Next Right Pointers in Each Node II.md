title: 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
tags: Tree, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a binary tree
```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

Example:
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

```
Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}

Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"5"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":1}

Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
```

Note:
1. You may only use constant extra space.
2. Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Work based on the question `116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node`
2. Iteratively 
```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)

/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        Node* cur = root;
        // Need to provide arguments for the Node constructor as it doesn't assign values by default 
        Node* dummy = new Node(0, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
        while (cur) {
            dummy->next = nullptr;
            Node* last = dummy;
            while (cur) {
                if (cur->left) {
                    last->next = cur->left;
                    last = last->next;
                }
                if (cur->right) {
                    last->next = cur->right;
                    last = last->next;
                }
                cur = cur->next;
            }
            cur = dummy->next;
        }
        delete dummy;
        dummy = nullptr;
        return root;
    }
};
```
3. Recursively
```c++
Time: O(N)
Space: O(N) or O(1), depending on whether implicit stack space counts or not.

/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return root;
    }
    void dfs(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        Node* dummy = new Node(0, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
        Node* last = dummy;
        
        while (root) {
            if (root->left) {
                last->next = root->left;
                last = last->next;
            }
            if (root->right) {
                last->next = root->right;
                last = last->next;
            }
            root = root->next;
        }
        dfs(dummy->next);
        delete dummy;
        dummy = nullptr;
    }
};
```
