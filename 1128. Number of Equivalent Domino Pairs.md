title: 1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs
tags: Hash table, easy
notebook: Leetcode
---
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a==c and b==d), or (a==d and b==c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.

Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].

Example 1:

```
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= dominoes.length <= 40000
- 1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9
----------
Thoughts:
1. Hash the dominoes in a way that the dominoes `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` will have a same key
   1. Swap two digits so that the smaller one comes first -> `(1,2)`
   2. Turn it into a integer -> `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`
2. Scan from right to left, use a hash table to keep track of the frequency of each key as we moving.
3. For each dominoes, search it's key in the hash table to see how many dominoes having the same key after it that can form a pair with it, add that number of pairs to the `count`.
4. Increase the frequency of key of current dominoes by 1 in the hash table.

    ```c++

    class Solution {
    public:
        int numEquivDominoPairs(vector<vector<int>>& dominoes) {
            unordered_map<int, int> m;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = dominoes.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                int h = gethash(dominoes[i]);
                count += m[h];
                m[h]++;
            }
            return count;
        }
        int gethash(vector<int> &dominoe) {
            // Hash the dominoe
            int i = dominoe[0];
            int j = dominoe[1];
            if (i > j) swap(i, j);
            return i * 10 + j;
        }
    };
```
