title: 809. Expressive Words
tags: String, medium
notebook: Leetcode

Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo", "hi" -> "hiiii".  In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".

For some given string S, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to S by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If S = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = S.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy. 

 

Example:
```
Input: 
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
``` 

Notes:

- 0 <= len(S) <= 100.
- 0 <= len(words) <= 100.
- 0 <= len(words[i]) <= 100.
- S and all words in words consist only of lowercase letters
 
----------
Thoughts:
1. For each `word` and `S`, iterate over two strings with two pointer `i, j`.
2. If `S[i] != word[j]` break for the current word.
3. Otherwise, check if `S[i]` has the group size of at least 3,
   1. If so, we can match the following same character in `word` and `S` by adding the char into `word`, so move both `i, j` of two strings to the next different character(group).
   2. Otherwise, we can't extend the current character, so just move both `i, j` to the next position.

    //Time:  O(N * L), N = words.size(), L = S.size()
    //Space: O(1)

                if (S.size() < word.size()) continue;
                int i = 0, j = 0;
                while (i < S.size() && j < word.size()) {
                    // If two current characters are not same, break;
                    if (S[i] != word[j]) break;
                    else {
                        // Check if the current char is extendable, i.e., the group of the char in S >= 3
                        if (i + 2 < S.size() && S[i] == S[i + 1] && S[i] == S[i + 2]) {
                            // If there are more than 3 current char in S in the current group, we can extend the number of this character in word to match the number of this char in S
                            // Move both i and j pointer to the next different char for next iteration
                            do {
