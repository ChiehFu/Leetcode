In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

1. a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
2. a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
3. a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
   
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
 ```

Note:

- 1 <= days.length <= 365
- 1 <= days[i] <= 365
- days is in strictly increasing order.
- costs.length == 3
- 1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

Top- voted solution:
1. Track calendar days\
We track the minimum cost for all calendar days in dp. For non-travel days, the cost stays the same as for the previous day. For travel days, it's a minimum of yesterday's cost plus single-day ticket, or cost for 8 days ago plus 7-day pass, or cost 31 days ago plus 30-day pass. \

    ```c++
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
    unordered_set<int> travel(begin(days), end(days));
    int dp[366] = {};
    for (int i = 1; i < 366; ++i) {
        if (travel.find(i) == travel.end()) dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
        else dp[i] = min({ dp[i - 1] + costs[0], dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1], dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2]});
    }
    return dp[365];
    }
    ```
    Optimizations \
    In the previous solution, we store cost for all calendar days. However, since we only look 30 days back, we can just store the cost for last 30 days in a rolling array.

    In addition, we can only look at calendar days within our first and last travel dates, as @zengxinhai suggested.
    ```c++
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
    unordered_set<int> travel(begin(days), end(days));
    int dp[30] = {};
    for (int i = days.front(); i <= days.back(); ++i) {
        if (travel.find(i) == travel.end()) dp[i % 30] = dp[(i - 1) % 30];
        else dp[i % 30] = min({ dp[(i - 1) % 30] + costs[0],
            dp[max(0, i - 7) % 30] + costs[1], dp[max(0, i - 30) % 30] + costs[2] });
    }
    return dp[days.back() % 30];
    }
    ``` 
    Complexity analysis
    - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of calendar days.
    - Space Complexity: O(N) or O(31) for the optimized solution. Stricter, it's a maximum duration among all pass types.

2. Track travel days \
We track the minimum cost for each travel day. We process only travel days and store {day, cost} for 7-and 30-day passes in the last7 and last30 queues. After a pass 'expires', we remove it from the queue. This way, our queues only contains travel days for the last 7 and 30 days, and the cheapest pass prices are in the front of the queues.\
![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/votrubac/image_1548617861.png)
    ```c++
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs, int cost = 0) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> last7, last30;
    for (auto d : days) {
        while (!last7.empty() && last7.front().first + 7 <= d) last7.pop();
        while (!last30.empty() && last30.front().first + 30 <= d) last30.pop();
        last7.push({ d, cost + costs[1] });
        last30.push({ d, cost + costs[2] });
        cost = min({ cost + costs[0], last7.front().second, last30.front().second });
    }
    return cost;
    }
    ```

    Complexity analysis 
    - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of travel days.
    - Space Complexity: O(38). Stricter, it's a sum of duration for all pass types (1 + 7 + 30 in our case).

Thoughts:

1. Use `buy[i]` to store the minimum cost to cover `days[0:i]`
2. To cover date `i`, we can buy `n-days` ticket at the date `(i - n) + 1` so that date `(i - n) + 1 ~ i` will be coverd
3. The cost will be the best cost before date `(i - n) + 1` + the cost for n-days ticket bought at date `(i - n) + 1`
4. For each date `i`, sotre the medium cost in `buy[i]`
5. Search the date before `n` by searching the first day after `n - 1` which say has the index `d`, `d - 1` will then be the result date

```c++
//Time: O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        vector<int> buy(days.size(), 0);
        vector<int> d{1, 7, 30};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < days.size(); i++) {
            int cost = INT_MAX;
            for (int c = 0; c < costs.size(); c++) {
                // To cover date i, we can buy d[c]-days ticket at the date (i - d[c]) + 1, 
                // so the cost will be the cost before date (i - d[c]) + 1 + the cost for d[c]-days ticket
                // To find the first number smaller than i, search the first number that greater than (i - 1), say it has the iterator it, it-- will then be the first number smaller than i.
                
                // Search the day before days[i] - d[c] + 1
                // Search the day days[i] - d[c] + 1 - 1 = days[i] - d[c]
                auto it = upper_bound(begin(days), begin(days) + i, days[i] - d[c]);
                if (it == begin(days)) {
                    // If there is no that date, the cost will be 0
                    cost = min(cost, costs[c]);
                } else {
                    it--;
                    // otherwise take it's cost (cost before days[i] - d[c] + 1) and buy a d[c]-days ticket at date (days[i] - d[c] + 1)
                    int index = it - begin(days);
                    cost = min(cost, buy[index] + costs[c]);
                }
            }
            
            // Offset the index by 1, store the best cost for days[i]
            buy[i] = cost;
        }
        return buy.back();
    }
};
