Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

- Only one letter can be changed at a time.
- Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
Example 1:

```c++
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```
Example 2:

```c++
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Treat this problem as a searching problem, and we're finding the shortest transformation so we can do BFS search.
2. Start from the starting word, the neighbors of the current word will be the word that are in the dictionary and differ with the current word by one letter.
3. For the words of each iteration, we find all it's neighbors and push it into the queue for next iteration, and when we push a word into the queue, we remove it from the dictionary to avoid repeatedly adding the same word. 
4. keep track of the number of iteration until we find the target word, and that number + 1 will be the answer.
5. If the endWord doesn't appear in the dictionary, return 0 directly.

    ```c++
    // Time :  O(25 * len * N), where len = the size of the word, N = the size of the dictionary
    // Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
            // Store the list of words in a hashset
            unordered_set<string> dict(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
            if (dict.find(endWord) == dict.end()) return 0;
            
            queue<string> q;
            q.push(beginWord);
            int step = 1;
            
            // BFS search for shortest transformation times
            
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int size = q.size();
                while (size--) {
                    string curWord = q.front(); q.pop();
                    if (curWord == endWord) return step;
                    
                    // Change each letter of the word to another 25 alphabets
                    for (int i = 0; i < curWord.size(); ++i) {
                        char tmp = curWord[i];
                        
                        for (int ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ++ch) {
                            if (ch == tmp) continue;
                            curWord[i] = ch;
                            if (dict.find(curWord) != dict.end()) {
                                dict.erase(curWord);
                                q.push(curWord);
                            }
                        }
                        // Recover this letter
                        curWord[i] = tmp;
                    }
                }
                ++step;
            }
            
            return 0;
        }
    };
    ```
6. Take one step further, we can do BFS from both start word and end word to cut down the time by half.

    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
            // Store the list of words in a hashset
            unordered_set<string> dict(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
            if (dict.find(endWord) == dict.end()) return 0;
            dict.erase(endWord);
            dict.erase(beginWord);
            
            queue<string> q1, q2;
            unordered_set<string> s1 = {beginWord}, s2 = {endWord};
            
            q1.push(beginWord);
            q2.push(endWord);
            
            int step = 2;
            // BFS search for shortest transformation times
            
            while (!q1.empty()) {
                int size = q1.size();
                unordered_set<string> s1_new;
                
                while (size--) {
                    string curWord = q1.front(); q1.pop();
                    
                    // Change each letter of the word to another 25 alphabets
                    for (int i = 0; i < curWord.size(); ++i) {
                        char tmp = curWord[i];
                        
                        for (int ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ++ch) {
                            if (ch == tmp) continue;
                            curWord[i] = ch;
                            if (s2.find(curWord) != s2.end()) return step;

                            if (dict.find(curWord) != dict.end()) {
                                dict.erase(curWord);
                                q1.push(curWord);
                                s1_new.insert(curWord);
                                //cout << curWord << " ";
                            }
                        }
                        
                        // Recover this letter
                        curWord[i] = tmp;
                    }
                
                }
                //cout << endl;
                ++step;
                swap(q1, q2);
                swap(s1, s1_new);
                swap(s1, s2);
            }
            
            return 0;
        }
    };
    ```
