Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.
```
Example 1:

Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```
```
Example 2:

Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```
```
Example 3:

Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```
Note:

- You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
- Do not use the eval built-in library function.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use a `sum` and `sign` variables for the calculation.
2. When we meet a sign operator, store it in the `sign with corresponding value` for the `value` later to use
3. When we meet a digit, extract the whole ``value``, and calculated it with the sign before it
   1. For the sign `'*'` and the sign `'/'`, the calculation will involved the last `value` we've calculated, so use `pre` to keep track of the last `value` we calculated and combined into the sum by whatever operators.
      1. Multiply / divide the `pre` by the `value` as the `result`, substract `sum` by pre, update `pre` to be the reuslt and add the `result` back to the sum.
   2. For the sign `'+' and '-'`, we just time the `value` we got by the sign as a `result`, update `pre` to be the reuslt and add the `result` to the sum.

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int calculate(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        int pre = 0;
        int  sign = 1; 
        // Sign:
        //  1: +
        // -1: -
        //  2: *
        //  3: /
        unordered_map<char, int> signs({{'+', 1}, {'-', -1}, {'*', 2}, {'/', 3}});
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') continue;
            else if (signs.find(s[i]) != end(signs)) {
                sign = signs[s[i]];
            } else if (isdigit(s[i])) {
                // get the whole number
                int val = 0;
                int j = i;
                while (j < s.size() && isdigit(s[j])) {
                    val = val * 10 + (s[j] - '0');
                    j++;
                }
                
                // calculate the sum based on the sign
                if (sign == 1 || sign == -1) {
                    pre = val * sign;
                    sum += pre;
                } else if (sign == 2) {
                    sum -= pre;
                    pre = pre * val;
                    sum += pre;
                } else {
                    sum -= pre;
                    pre = pre / val;
                    sum += pre;
                }
                //
                i = j - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
