title: 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person
tags: Array
notebook: Leetcode
---

In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
```

Note:

- 1 <= seats.length <= 20000
- seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the array and find the index of every pairs of `1s`, calculate the maximized closest distance between them.
2. If the first `1`/ last `1` is on the `i` / `j`, where `i != 0, j != n - 1`, we can choose the position `0` / `n - 1`, and the maximized closest distance will be `i - 0` / `n - 1 - j`.
3. Report the best maximized closest distance.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int last = -1;
        int dis = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                // Handle the first 1, we it's not on the index 0, we can choose index 0, and will get the distance (i - 0) = i
                if (last == -1) dis = i;
                else dis = max(dis, (i - last) / 2);
                last = i;
            }
        }
        // Handle the last 1, if it's not the last one, we can choose the last one, and will get the distance (n - 1 - last)
        dis = max(dis, (int)seats.size() - 1 - last);
        return dis;
    }
};
```
