Given a number N, return true if and only if it is a confusing number, which satisfies the following condition:

We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. When 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid. A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a different number with each digit valid.

 

Example 1:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/23/1268_1.png)

```
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 
We get 9 after rotating 6, 9 is a valid number and 9!=6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 89
Output: true
Explanation: 
We get 68 after rotating 89, 86 is a valid number and 86!=89.
```

Note:

- 0 <= N <= 10^9
- After the rotation we can ignore leading zeros, for example if after rotation we have 0008 then this number is considered as just 8.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the every digit of the number from lsb to msb:
   1. For each digit, use the flipped digit to build the number from msb to lsb.
   2. If the number contains any digit of `2, 3, 4, 5, 7`, return false directly.
   3. Compare the new number and the old one to see if they are different.
2. Use a vector `v` where `v[i]` is the flipped number of `i`, e.g., `v[6] = 9, v[1] = 1`, `v[i] = -1` if the flipped number is invalid.

```c++
//Time:  O(L), L = the number of digit the input
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    bool confusingNumber(int N) {
        vector<int> v = {0, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 9, -1, 8, 6};
        int ans = 0;
        int tmp = N;
        
        while (tmp) {
            int n = tmp % 10;
            tmp = tmp / 10;
            if (v[n] == -1) return false;
            ans = ans * 10 + v[n];
        }

        return ans != N;
    }
};
```
