Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Example 1:
```c++
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```
Example 3:
```c++
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```
Note:

- All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
- 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two pointers, first pointer `p1` is the index used to iterate the input string, second pointer `p2` is the index of the next position to write the final result
2. Use `p1` to iterate the string and each time, count for the number of times a character shows, stop once we encounter another character.
3. Use `p2` to write the compressed string to the original input for each character we count 

```c++
//Time: O(L)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        if (chars.empty()) return 0;
        int indexAns = 0;
        int index = 0;
        
        while(index < chars.size()) {
            int count = 0;
            int c = chars[index];
            while (index < chars.size() && c == chars[index]) {
                count++;
                index++;
            }
            chars[indexAns++] = c;
            if (count > 1) {
                for (char n : to_string(count)) {
                    chars[indexAns++] = n;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return indexAns;
    }
};
```
