title: 658. Find K Closest Elements
tags: Binary Search, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```
Note:

1. The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
2. Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10^4
3. Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10^4

2 Solutions:
1. Find two number closest to the target, use two pointers for left/right boundaries and expand the boundary sequentially to find the most closest k value

    ```c++
    //Time: O(logN + k)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> findClosestElements(vector<int>& arr, int k, int x) {
            if (arr.empty()) return {};
            int r = distance(begin(arr), lower_bound(begin(arr), end(arr), x));
            int l = r - 1;

            // use r and l such that the interval (l, r) of nums contains k closet elements to the target

            while (r - l - 1 < k) {
                if (l < 0) r++;
                else if (r == arr.size()) l--;
                else if (abs(arr[l] - x) > abs(arr[r] - x)) {
                    r++;
                } else {
                    l--;
                }
            }
            
            return vector<int>(begin(arr) + l + 1, begin(arr) + r);
        }
    };
    ```
2. Binary search to search the starting index of the interval being closest to the target:
   1. Say we are in the interval `[l, r]` and pick the middle `m`, compare `nums[m] and nums[m + k]` to see which is closer to the target, `nums[m]` is the starting point of the interval `[m : m + k - 1]` and `nums[m + k]` is the ending point of the interval `[m + 1 : m + k]`
      1. if `nums[m] == nums[m + k]`,  both cases are same which means we can move both ways, however, we want to move to the side that closer to target as there might be the chance we find a candidate closer to the target than our current pick, consider the example like `nums = [1,2,2,2,3,3], x = 3, k = 2`
      2. Otherwise:
         1. if (abs(nums[m] - target) > abs(nums[m + k] - target)), move to right `[m + 1, r]`
         2. else move to left `[l, m]`

    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> findClosestElements(vector<int>& A, int k, int x) {
            int left = 0, right = A.size() - k;
            while (left < right) {
                int mid = (left + right) / 2;
                if (A[mid] == A[mid + k]) {
                    // handle the case where both candidates are same
                    // move to the interval closer to target as we might find a candidate closer than our current pick
                    if (A[mid] < x) left = mid + 1;
                    else right = mid;
                } else if (abs(x - A[mid]) > abs(A[mid + k] - x))
                    left = mid + 1;
                else
                    right = mid;
            }
            return vector<int>(A.begin() + left, A.begin() + left + k);
        }
    };
    ```
