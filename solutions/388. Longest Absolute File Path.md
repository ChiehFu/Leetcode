title: 388. Longest Absolute File Path
tags: string, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:
```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```
The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:
- The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
- The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..

Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.

Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use `\n` to separate the directories in the string and store in a vector `dirs`.
2. The special characters like `\t`, `\n` are counted as a single char.
3. Use a vector `length` to store a length of the directory name for each level.
4. Iterate over `dirs`, for each directory, count the number of `\t` to get it's level `d`, and update the corresponding length in `length[d]`.
5. If current directory is a file, accumulate the length in `length` from `0 ~ d`, and add the length for slash used to separate the directories (same amount as `d`).
6. Keep track of the longest one.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthLongestPath(string input) {
        vector<string> dirs;
        // Separate the directories and store in a vector
        divide_dirs(input, dirs);

        // Use a vector to store the length of each directory for each level as we iterate over all directories
        vector<int> levels(dirs.size());
        int res = 0;
        for (string & dir : dirs) {
            // Count the depth of current level
            int depth = count(dir.begin(), dir.end(), '\t');
            // Update the length at the corresponding level (remember to exclude the length for '\t')
            levels[depth] = dir.size() - depth;
            // If the current directory is actually a file 
            if (dir.find('.') != string::npos) {
                int d = 0;
                // Count the length from level 0 to depth
                for (int i = 0; i <= depth; i++) d += levels[i];
                // Add the length of the slash needed 
                d += depth;
                res = max(res, d);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    void divide_dirs(string &s, vector<string> &v) {
        stringstream ss(s);
        string tmp = "";
        // getline will separate the substring by '\t' by default, and each time put one substring into tmp
        while (getline(ss, tmp, '\n')) v.push_back(tmp);
    }
};
