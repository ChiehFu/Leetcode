Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:

1. The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
2. The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
3. If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
4. When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

Your job is to implement the following functions:

The constructor function:

`AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): `This is the constructor. The input is **historical data**. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:

`List<String> input(char c):` The input `c` is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (`'a' to 'z'`), blank space (`' '`) or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.

 
**Example:**
**Operation:** AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times: \
"i love you" : 5 times\
"island" : 3 times\
"ironman" : 2 times\
"i love leetcode" : 2 times\
Now, the user begins another search:

**Operation:** input('i') \
**Output:** ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"] \
**Explanation:** \
There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.

**Operation:** input(' ') \
**Output:** ["i love you","i love leetcode"] \
**Explanation:** \
There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".

**Operation:** input('a') \
**Output:** [] \
**Explanation:** \
There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".

**Operation:** input('#') \
**Output:** [] \
**Explanation:**  \
The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.

 
Note:

- The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.
- The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
- Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.
- Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.

Thoughts:
1. Use Trie to store the strings 
2. Store additional information in each trie node similar to the concept in the question [336. Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs)
3. The structure of the Trie Node is as below:
    ```c++
    struct TrieNode {
        // Index is used to identify that the prefix formed from the root to this Trie node is representing a word having that index in the input string 
        int index;
        vector<TrieNode*> children;
        // Store the index of the words in string vector that shared the prefix string from root the current trie node
        vector<int> prefix;
        TrieNode() {
            index = -1;
            // Index 0-25 are used for lowercase alphabets [a-z] and index 26 is used for blank space
            children.assign(27, nullptr);
        }
    };
    ```
```c++
class AutocompleteSystem {
public:
    AutocompleteSystem(vector<string>& sentences, vector<int>& times) {
        times_ = times;
        sentences_ = sentences;
        root_ = new TrieNode();
        search_ = "";
        cur_ = root_;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.size(); i++) {
            add(sentences[i], i);
        }
    }
    
    vector<string> input(char c) {
        if (c == '#') {
            if (cur_ && cur_->index != -1) {
                times_[cur_->index]++;
            } else {
                sentences_.push_back(search_);
                times_.push_back(1);
                add(search_, times_.size() - 1);
            }
            
            search_ = "";
            cur_ = root_;
            return {};
        } else {
            search_ += c;
            
            // Handle the special cases ' ', as we use the offset in ASCII-code for the alphabet [a-z]
            int j = isalpha(c)? c - 'a':26;
            
            if (cur_ && cur_->children[j]) {
                
                cur_ = cur_->children[j];
                
                auto cmp = [&](int &a, int &b) {
                    return times_[a] != times_[b]? times_[a] > times_[b] : sentences_[a] < sentences_[b];
                };
                
                // Here we can also apply partial_sort to sort the words based on frequency and alphabetic ordering
                priority_queue<int, vector<int>, decltype(cmp)> q(cmp);
