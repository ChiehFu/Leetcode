Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

Example:
Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
```
The input is: vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries , where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return vector<double>.
```
According to the example above:

```
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
``` 

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

----------
Thoughts:
1. If there is a pair for `<a, b>` with the value `i`, build the `edge<a, b>` with the weight `i` and `edge<b, a>` with a weight `1/i`.
2. For a query `<a, b>`, start from `a` use BFS/DFS search the graph to find the path from `a` to `b`, in the meantime, maintain a value (starts from 1) for the product of the weights along the path, that value will be the relation between `a` and `b`.
3. Return -1 if `a` or `b` is not in the graph.
