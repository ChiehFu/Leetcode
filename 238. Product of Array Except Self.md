title: 238. Product of Array Except Self
tags: Array
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
```
Follow up:
- Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Thoughts:
1. Two scans:
   1. Scan from left to right:
      1. Maintain a current product value, propagate the accumulative product to each position from left to right.
      2. For the position `i`, it'll receive a accumulative product of the sub array `[0, i - 1]`.
   2. Scan from right to left:
      1. Maintain a current product value, propagate the accumulative product to each position from right to left
      2. For the position `i`, it'll receive a accumulative product of the sub array `[i + 1, n - 1]`.
   3. Finally, each position `i` will have the product of `[0, i - 1] * [i + 1, n - 1]`.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<int> res(nums.size(), 1);
            int acc_l = 1, acc_r = 1;
            for (int l = 0; l < nums.size(); ++l) {
                int r = nums.size() - 1 - l;
                res[l] *= acc_l;
                res[r] *= acc_r;
                acc_l *= nums[l];
                acc_r *= nums[r];
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
