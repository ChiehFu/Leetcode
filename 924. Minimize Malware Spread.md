title: 924. Minimize Malware Spread
tags: Union find, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

In a network of nodes, each node i is directly connected to another node j if and only if graph[i][j] = 1.

Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed, would minimize M(initial).  If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.

Note that if a node was removed from the initial list of infected nodes, it may still be infected later as a result of the malware spread.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0
```
```
Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]
Output: 0
```
```
Example 3:

Input: graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]
Output: 1
 ```

Note

- 1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300
- 0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1
- graph[i][i] = 1
- 1 <= initial.length < graph.length
- 0 <= initial[i] < graph

Thoughts:
1. Union find to union the components, and keep track of the size of all components by thier parent
2. Iterate through the list of the initially-infected nodes, look up the size of the component they belong to, and the numebr of the initially-affected nodes in it's component.
    1. If there are more than 1 malware node in this component, we can at most save 1 node from begin affected which is exact the node we are removing from initial (other nodes will still be affcted by the other initially-affected nodes in this component)
    2. If there is only 1 initially-affected node, we can save the whole component by removing this node, which will be the number of the component itself
3. Pick the node that can save the most amount of nodes (for nodes having the same amount, report the one with small node value)
