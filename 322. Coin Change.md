You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```
Note:
- You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Use `dp[i][j]` for the minimal number of coins needed to make the amount `j` by using coins `[0:i-1]`.
   1. `dp[i][0] = 0` for base case
2. To solve `dp[i][j]` we can look the optimum of two sub-problems
   1. `dp[i - 1]][j]`, if we just use pre `i-1` kinds of coin to make the amount 
   2. `dp[i - 1][j - coin[i - 1]] + 1` , we pick `coin[i - 1]` right now, so we need to know the solution of `dp[i - 1][j - coin[i - 1]]` and plus 1 for this new added coin.
3. Since when calculating for `dp[i][j]`, the sub-problems we need are `dp[i-1][j] and dp[i-1][0:j - 1]`, 2D dp table can be optimized to 1D table.


```c++
//DP
//Time: O(C * amount), C = # of coins
//Space: O(amount)

class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        const int max = amount + 1;
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, max);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (auto &coin : coins) {
                if (i - coin >= 0) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == max? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};

```
