title: 886. Possible Bipartition
tags: DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given a set of `N` people (numbered `1, 2, ..., N`), we would like to split everyone into two groups of **any** size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 

Formally, if `dislikes[i] = [a, b]`, it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered `a` and `b` into the same group.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
``` 

Note:

- `1 <= N <= 2000`
- `0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000`
- `1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N`
- `dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]`
- There does not exist `i != j` for which `dislikes[i] == dislikes[j]`.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Essentially the coloring problem where two adjacent nodes in the graph should have different color.
2. In this question, the total number of different color is `2`.

    ```Java
    //DFS
    //Time: O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
        private ArrayList<Integer> [] neighbors;
        private int[] side;
        public boolean possibleBipartition(int N, int[][] dislikes) {
            neighbors = new ArrayList[N + 1];
            for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
                neighbors[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
            }
            side = new int[N + 1];
            
            for (int[] edge : dislikes) {
                neighbors[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
                neighbors[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
            }
            
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
                if (side[i] == 0) {
                    if (!dfs(1, i)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            return true;
        }
        
        private boolean dfs(int parentColor, int current) {
            if (side[current] != 0) {
                if (side[current] == parentColor) {
                    return false;
                }
                return true;
            }
            side[current] = -parentColor;
            for (int neighbor : neighbors[current]) {
                if (!dfs(side[current], neighbor)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
