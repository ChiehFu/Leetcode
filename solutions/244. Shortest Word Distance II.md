notebook: Leetcode

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```
Note:
- You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
----------
Thoughts:
1. For each word, store the index of the positions it shows in `words` in an ascending order.
2. For the two given words with two vectors of index, the question essentially becomes finding the minimal distance between two indices from two vectors.
   1. If the vectors are sorted, we can apply two pointers technique to find the minimal distance in `O(N)` just like the question [243. Shortest Word Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/)

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class WordDistance {
    public:
        WordDistance(vector<string>& words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
                indices[words[i]].push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        int shortest(string word1, string word2) {
            vector<int> &v1 = indices[word1];
            vector<int> &v2 = indices[word2];
            int dis = INT_MAX;
            
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < v1.size() && j < v2.size();) {
                dis = min(dis, abs(v1[i] - v2[j]));
                if (v1[i] > v2[j]) j++;
                else i++;
            }
            
            return dis;
        }
    private:
        unordered_map<string, vector<int>> indices;
    };

    /**
    * Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
    * WordDistance* obj = new WordDistance(words);
    * int param_1 = obj->shortest(word1,word2);
    */
    ```
