title: 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.         
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

Thoughts:
1. Use `dp[i]` for the maximum profit that we can make form house `[0:i]`
2. When we are at `j`, `dp[j]` will the the maximum of the two cases:
   1. Steal `jth` house -> `val[j] + dp[j - 2]` (profit of `[0:j-2]th` house because we can't steal `(j-1)th` house)
   2. Not steal -> `dp[j - 1]`
3. to update `dp[i]` we need only `dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]`, use two variables `pre, prepre` to replace, and update these two variables after each computation

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int pre = 0;
        int prepre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int cur = max(prepre + nums[i], pre);
            swap(pre, prepre);
            pre = cur;
        }
        return pre;
    }
};
```
