Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees): \
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
```c++
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. If a tree is at least a complete tree and `the depth from root to left-most leaf` is same as `the depth from root to right-most leaf`, it's a `full binary tree`, of which the number of nodes is `pow(2, depth) - 1`.
2. Recursively calculate the tree nodes :
    1. For each subtree with a parent, if it's a full binary tree, calculate the number of nodes directly and return.
    2. Otherwise, divide the tree into parent, left and right sub-trees and solve separately and return the sum of these three in the end. 
3. To avoid recalculate the depth from root to leaf, pass the precalculate result to the later recursive function.

```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(logN)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root, -1, -1);
    }
    int helper(TreeNode* root, int left, int right) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        int l = (left == -1)? count(root, true) : left;
        int r = (right == -1)? count(root, false) : right;
        
        // If the tree is full, calculate the number of nodes directly 
        if (l == r) return pow(2, l) - 1;
        // Otherwise, divide the tree into root, left, and right 
        else return 1 + helper(root->left, l - 1, -1) + helper(root->right, -1, r - 1);
    }
    int count(TreeNode* root, bool isLeft) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        int depth = 0;
        while (cur) {
            depth += 1;
            if (isLeft) cur = cur->left;
            else cur = cur->right;
        }
        return depth;
    }
};
