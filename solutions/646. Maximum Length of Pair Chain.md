You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]
Note:
The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Normal Dynamic Programming solution:

    ```c++
    // Time:  O(N^2 + NlogN)
    // Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int findLongestChain(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
            vector<int> dp(pairs.size(), 1);
            sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());
            int longest = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < pairs.size(); ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                    if (pairs[i][0] > pairs[j][1]) {
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                    }
                    longest = max(longest, dp[i]);
                }
            }
            
            return longest;
        }
    };
    ```

2. Greedy
    1. The way we handle those intervals are very similar to the Merge Interval problem 
    2. The main differences are:
        1. We only need to know the longest chain
        2. We don't have to take all intervals
    3. So the strategy will be:
        1. After sort the interval according to the first argument, as we scan through the sorted intervals, we only need to care about the second argument.
        2. Use `last` to represent the second argument of the last interval in current longest chain.
        3. Use `len` represent the length of the chain we've form in this greedy fashion.
        4. Update `last` and `len` according to the following rules::
            ```
            Say we have last, len and curr_interval as we scan through the sorted intervals:

            if (curr_interval[0] > last):
                Means the new interval and the previous last interval has no intersection, and can form a chain, so :
                1. Update last = curr_interval[1], and 
                2. Increase len by 1
            else:
                Means curr_interval and previous last interval are overlapping, we want to keep our last as small as possible so set last = min(last, curr_interval[1])
            ```

    ```c++
    // Time : O(NlogN)
    // Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int findLongestChain(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
            sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());
            int last = INT_MIN;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < pairs.size(); ++i) {
                if (pairs[i][0] > last) {
                    last = pairs[i][1];
                    ++count;
                } else {
                    last = min(last, pairs[i][1]);
                }
            }
            
            return count;
        }
    };
    ```
