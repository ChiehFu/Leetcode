notebook: Leetcode

Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target k in the tree.

Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.

```
Example 1:

Input:
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output: 2 (or 3)

Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
```
```
Example 2:

Input:
root = [1], k = 1
Output: 1

Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
```
```
Example 3:

Input:
root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

Output: 3

Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
```
Note:
1. `root` represents a binary tree with at least 1 node and at most 1000 nodes.
2. Every node has a unique `node.val` in range [1, 1000].
There exists some node in the given binary tree for which `node.val == k.`

----------

Thoughts:
1. See the tree as a graph, and perform BFS starting from `node k` to find the closest node that is a leaf.
2. To traverse from `node k` to it's parent direction, we need the backedges as in the tree structure, there are only edges from parents to children (In Tree, every node except for root have only 1 backedges which links to its parent, so use a one-one map is sufficient)
3. Traverse the tree to find the node k as we later need to do bfs from it. In the mean time, build the backedges for those nodes that on the path from root to node k, as only those nodes need the backedges by which we can access them from node k in our later dfs traversal. (backedges for other nodes are not required because we can use original tree edge to reach them)
4. Do BFS and consider three possible edge: 1. tree left edge, 2. tree right edge, 3. parent edge if there is one. Use hashset to store those nodes visited.
