title: 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest
tags: Tree, medium, DFS
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/01/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-53836-pm.png)

```c++
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
- Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
- to_delete.length <= 1000
- to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Push all target values into a hash set for quick search.
2. Recursively traverse the tree.
3. If current node needs to be removed, we add it's children into the result vector, and return null to it's parent.
4. Otherwise, just return itself to it's parent.
5. For each parent, when solving the sub recursions for it's children, we get a returned node for each child which either is `NULL` or the original child depending on if the child was removed, so set the child pointer to the returned node anyway.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(N)

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        vector<TreeNode*> forest;
        unordered_set<int> targets(to_delete.begin(), to_delete.end());
        // Remember to push the root in the end if it's not removed! 
        if (helper(root, forest, targets)) forest.push_back(root);
        return forest;
    }
    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode* node, vector<TreeNode*> &forest, unordered_set<int> &targets) {
        if (!node) return nullptr;
        
        // Theoretically, we should handle the subtree of the children before handling the current subtree, because there might be some children need to be removed. 
        // However, we are storing pointer pointer to a tree structure, so we can alway delete children from the tree by the children pointer.
        // But here we still do it in post-order
        // Go left and right
        node->left = helper(node->left, forest, targets);
        node->right = helper(node->right, forest, targets);
        // Check current
        if (targets.count(node->val)) {
            if (node->left) forest.push_back(node->left);
            if (node->right) forest.push_back(node->right);
            //delete node;
            node = nullptr;
        }
        return node;
    }
};
