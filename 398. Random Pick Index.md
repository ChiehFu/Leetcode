title: 398. Random Pick Index
tags: Reservoir Sampling, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:
```
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```

1. Reservoir Sampling

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
            nums_ = move(nums);
            srand(time(NULL));
        }
        
        int pick(int target) {
            int pick = -1;
            int size = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < nums_.size(); ++i) {
                if (nums_[i] == target) {
                    if (rand() % (size + 1) == 0) {
                        pick = i;
                    }
                    size++;
                }
            }
            return pick;
        }
    private:
        vector<int> nums_;
    };

    /**
    * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
    * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
    * int param_1 = obj->pick(target);
    */
    ```
