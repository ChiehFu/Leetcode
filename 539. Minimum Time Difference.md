title: 539. Minimum Time Difference
tags: String, medium, bucket sort

iven a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
Example 1:
```
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```
Note:
- The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
- The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Convert the time points to minute-based and sort them.
2. Push a extra value which is the smallest minutes + `24 * 60` to cover the distance from last time point to first time points.
3. Iterate over the minute-based time and compare two consecutive to calculate the difference and keep track of the minimum.

```c++
//Time:  O(SN + NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDifference(vector<string>& timePoints) {
        vector<int> time;
        for (auto &point : timePoints) {
            time.push_back(stoi(point.substr(0, 2)) * 60 + stoi(point.substr(3)));
        } 
        sort(time.begin(), time.end());
        // Push the minute of first day + 24 hours for the corner case
        time.push_back((time.front() + 24 * 60));
        int min_diff = 24 * 60;
        for (int i = 0; i < time.size() - 1; i++) {
            min_diff = min(min_diff, time[i + 1] - time[i]);
        }
        
        return min_diff;
    }
};
```
2. Bucket sort
    1. There might be duplicate time points, store the count in the corresponding bucket.
```c++
//Bucket sort
//Time:  O(SN + 24 * 60)
//Space: O(24 * 60)

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDifference(vector<string>& timePoints) {
        vector<int> mark(24 * 60);
        for (auto &time : timePoints) {
            int hour = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
            int min = stoi(time.substr(3));
            ++mark[hour * 60 + min];
        }
        int min_diff = 24 * 60;
        int first_time = -1;
        int pre_time = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < mark.size(); i++) {
            if (mark[i]) {
                // If any time point showing more than twice, directly return the minimal difference 0
                if (mark[i] > 1) return 0;
                if (first_time == -1) first_time = i;
                if (pre_time != -1) {
                    min_diff = min(min_diff, i - pre_time);
                }
                pre_time = i;
            }
        }
        min_diff = min(min_diff, first_time + 1440 - pre_time);
        return min_diff;
    }
};
```
