Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

Note: 
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

Could you solve it in linear time?

Thoughts:
1. Scan through the array and maintain a sliding window of size `k`.
2. Problem: How do we get the maximum of the element in the window efficiently?
   1. Max-Heap:
      1. For each element, push the pair `pair<value, index>` in to the heap.
      2. Because we can't randomly remove a element in the heap, some element might be stale (out of the window), we can judge if the one on the top is valid(lie in current window) by comparing the index.
      3. Do lazy deletion for those stale element.
        ```c++
        //Max-Heap
        //Time:  O(NlogN)
        //Space: O(N)

        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
                priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, less<pair<int, int>>> pq;
                vector<int> res;
                for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                    pq.push({nums[i], i});
                    if (i >= k - 1) {
                        while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().second <= i - k) pq.pop();
                        if (!pq.empty()) res.push_back(pq.top().first);
                    }
                }
                return res;
            }
        };     
        ```
   1. Dequeue:
      1. We use a dequeue to store the potential candidates for the next maximum.
      2. When we add a value `val[j]` into the current window, 
      3. If this value is greater than the candidates values before it `val[i], where j > i` in the dequeue, there is no chance for `val[i]` to be a maximum given the existence of `val[j]`, pop back such `val[j]` from the dequeue, and push `val[j]` into the dequeue as the candidate.
      4. It `val[j]` is smaller than the previous candidate `val[i]` in the dequeue, `val[j]` can't replace by it can be a potential maximum after `val[i]` is removed, so push it into the dequeue.
      5. As we shift the window, if the maximum on the front of the dequeue if out of window, pop it from the front of the dequeue. 
        ```c++
        //Dequeue
        //Time:  O(N)
        //Space: O(N)

        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
                deque<int> dq;
                vector<int> res;
                for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
                    while (!dq.empty() && nums[i] > dq.back()) dq.pop_back();
                    dq.push_back(nums[i]);
                    if (i >= k - 1) {
                        if (i > k - 1 && dq.front() == nums[i - k]) dq.pop_front();
                        res.push_back(dq.front());
                    }
                }
                return res;
            }
        };
        ```
