title: 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination
tags: DFS, Graph, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

Given the edges of a directed graph, and two nodes source and destination of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from source eventually end at destination, that is:

At least one path exists from the source node to the destination node
If a path exists from the source node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to destination.
The number of possible paths from source to destination is a finite number.
Return true if and only if all roads from source lead to destination.

 

Example 1:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_1.png)
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.
```
Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_2.png)
```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
```
Example 3:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_3.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true
```


Note:

- The given graph may have self loops and parallel edges.
- The number of nodes n in the graph is between 1 and 10000
- The number of edges in the graph is between 0 and 10000
- 0 <= edges.length <= 10000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= source <= n - 1
- 0 <= destination <= n - 1

Thoughts:
1. DFS + cycle detection + cache

    ```c++
    //Time: O(V + E)
    //Space: O(E)
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool leadsToDestination(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int source, int destination) {
            neighbors.assign(n, vector<int>());
            for (auto &edge : edges) {
                neighbors[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            }
            if (!neighbors[destination].empty()) return false;
            vector<int> onPath(n, 0);
            return helper(source, destination, onPath);
        }
        bool helper(int cur, int dst, vector<int> &onPath) {
            // If there is a cycle, return false
            if (onPath[cur]) return false;
            if (cur == dst) return true;
            if (neighbors[cur].empty()) return false;
            
            if (cache.find(cur) != cache.end()) return true;
            onPath[cur] = 1;
            for (auto n : neighbors[cur]) {
                if (!helper(n, dst, onPath)) return false;
            }
            onPath[cur] = 0;
            cache.insert(cur);
            return true;
        }
    private:
        vector<vector<int>> neighbors;
        unordered_set<int> cache;
    };
    ```
