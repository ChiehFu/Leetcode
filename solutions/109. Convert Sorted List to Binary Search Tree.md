Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

----------
Thoughts:

**Solution 1:**
1. Build the tree from top to bottom recursively.
2. In each recursion, use two pointers to find the middle node of the list and divide the list into two parts.
3. Use the middle node as the parent node, and use the left and the right part lists to build the left and right subtree for the parent node recursively.
4. Connect the parent to it's children and return the parent.

```c++
//Recursive Top-Down solution
//Time:  O(NlogN), each recursion takes O(N) to find the middle node and divide the linked list into two.
//Space: O(logN)

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;
        if (!head->next) return new TreeNode(head->val);
        
        // Divide the list into two parts left and right, and a middle node used as the parent
        auto pre = head, slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            pre = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        pre->next = nullptr;
        
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(slow->val);
        node->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        node->right = sortedListToBST(slow->next);
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

**Solution 2:**
1. Since order of the in-order traversal is same as the order of a sorted list, we can build the tree from bottom to top in in-order ordering, so that we can build the tree node in the order same as the order of the original linked list.
2. Find the length of the list, for each recursion, call the sub recursions based on the corresponding boundary recursively.
3. As we in-order visit a node in each recursion, we take one node from the list and build a parent node with it's value. 
4. Link the parent node to the subtrees returned from sub recursions.
5. Pass a pointer by reference which points at the next node in the list, so that we can sequentially take one node out of the list as we recurring back to build the tree node.

```c++
//Recursive Bottom-Up solution
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(logN)

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        int len = 0;
        auto cur = head;
        // Count the length of the linked list, use us the boundary to build the tree in in-order ordering 
        while (cur) {
            len++;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        return inOrderBuild(1, len, head);
    }
    
    TreeNode* inOrderBuild(int l, int r, ListNode* &next) {
        if (l > r) return nullptr;

        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        // Build the tree in in-order ordering 
        
        // Call for solving left subtree
        TreeNode* left = inOrderBuild(l, m - 1, next);
        
        // Build the parent node
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(next->val);
        // Move forward the next pointer of the linked list
        next = next->next;
        // Connect the parent with it's left child
        node->left = left;
        
        // Call and connect the parent with it's right child
        node->right = inOrderBuild(m + 1, r, next);
        
        return node;
    }
