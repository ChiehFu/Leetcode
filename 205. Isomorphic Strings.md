Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
Note:
- You may assume both s and t have the same length.

Thoughts:
1. If two strings want to be isomorphic, they need to have the same character distribution in their string structure.
2. Iterate over two string and use two hash table to store the mapping between two characters `a, b` appearing at the same index (first hash map map `a` to `b`, second one map `b` to `a`).
3. Every time meet the character that has shown in the past, check if the current mapping between two character conforms the previous mapping.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
            if (s.size() != t.size()) return false;
            unordered_map<char, char> s_to_t, t_to_s;
            for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
                char a = s[i], b = t[i];
                if (s_to_t.find(s[i]) == s_to_t.end() && t_to_s.find(t[i]) == t_to_s.end()) {
                    s_to_t[s[i]] = t[i];
                    t_to_s[t[i]] = s[i];
                } else if (s_to_t.find(s[i]) != s_to_t.end() && t_to_s.find(t[i]) != t_to_s.end()) {
                    if (s_to_t[s[i]] != t[i] || t_to_s[t[i]] != s[i]) return false;
                } else return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
4. Use a vector to replace the hash table to speed up the access time.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(256)
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
            int m1[256] = {0}, m2[256] = {0}, n = s.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (m1[s[i]] != m2[t[i]]) return false;
                m1[s[i]] = i + 1;
                m2[t[i]] = i + 1;
            }
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
