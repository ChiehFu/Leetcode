There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.

The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

Example 1:

```
Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)

Output: 12

Explanation: One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
             The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
```

----------

Thoughts:
1. **Key observation**:
   1. We can only visit the position where we have a stop.
   2. See those positions we can stop as the vertex, which composed of a graph.
   3. The problem becomes finding the shortest path from the starting point to the destination point in this graph.
   4. Apply the algorithm like dijkstra to find the shortest path.
2. Use priority queue to implement the dijkstra algorithm

```c++
//Time:  O(nlogn)
//Space: O(n)

    struct point {
        int x;
        int y;
        int d;
        point(int x_, int y_, int d_) : x(x_), y(y_), d(d_) {};
    };
    
    int shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>>& maze, vector<int>& start, vector<int>& destination) {
        
        vector<vector<int>> visited(maze.size(), vector<int>(maze[0].size(), 0));
        
        auto cmp = [] (point *p, point *q) {
            return p->d > q->d;
        };
        
        priority_queue<point*, vector<point*>, decltype(cmp)> pq(cmp);
        pq.push(new point(start[0], start[1], 0));
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto cur_point = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            
            int x = cur_point->x;
            int y = cur_point->y;
            int d = cur_point->d;
            visited[x][y] = 1;
                            
            for (auto &dir : dirs) {
                int nxt_x = x, nxt_y = y, nxt_d = d;
                
                
                while (nxt_x + dir[0] >= 0 && nxt_x + dir[0] < maze.size() &&
                       nxt_y + dir[1] >= 0 && nxt_y + dir[1] < maze[0].size() &&
                        maze[nxt_x + dir[0]][nxt_y + dir[1]] != 1) {
                    nxt_x += dir[0];
                    nxt_y += dir[1];
                    ++nxt_d;
                }
                
                if (visited[nxt_x][nxt_y]) continue;
                
                if (nxt_x == destination[0] && nxt_y == destination[1]) return nxt_d;
                pq.push(new point(nxt_x, nxt_y, nxt_d));
            }
            
        }
        return -1;
    }

private:
    vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};    
};
