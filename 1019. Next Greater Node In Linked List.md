title: 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List
tags: Linked List, Stack
notebook: Leetcode
---

We are given a linked list with head as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: node_1, node_2, node_3, ... etc.

Each node may have a next larger value: for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the node_j.val such that j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest possible choice.  If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0.

Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}).

Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below, arrays such as [2,1,5] represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1]
Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0]
```

Note:

- 1 <= node.val <= 10^9 for each node in the linked list.
- The given list has length in the range [0, 10000].

Thoughts:
1. Linked list version of the question [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
2. As we traverse the linked list and use a stack to find next greater node for every nodes, assign an id starting from 0 to the node we visited, and push a 0 into the result vector for that node too.
3. Push the node value with it's id into the stack
4. As we have found the next greater node `A` for node `B` with index `i` in the stack, update `res[i] = A->val`

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextLargerNodes(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> res;
        stack<pair<int, int>> s;
        int i = 0;
        while (head) {
            res.push_back(0);
            while (!s.empty() && head->val > s.top().first) {
                res[s.top().second] = head->val;
                s.pop();
            }
            s.push({head->val, i++});
            head = head->next;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
