title: 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

notebook: Leetcode

We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
```
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```
Note:

- A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
- A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].

Thoughts:
1. Dynamic Programming:
2. Use `dp[i][swap]/dp[i][not_swap]` to represent the number of swapping operations required and swap/not swap at `i` to make both `A[0:i] and B[0:i]` strictly increasing.
3. For `A[i + 1] and B[i + 1]` we can make swap or not based on the four conditions:
   1. If `A[i + 1] > A[i] && B[i + 1] > B[i]`:
      1. If we don't swap at `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1][not_swap] = dp[i][not_swap]`.
      2. If we swap at `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1][swap] = dp[i][swap] + 1`.
   2. If `A[i + 1] > B[i] && B[i + 1] > A[i]`:
      1.  If we don't swap at `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1][not_swap] = dp[i][swap]`.
      2. If we swap at `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1][swap] = dp[i][not_swap] + 1`.
4. `dp[i][]` only depends on `dp[i - 1]`, so we can optimize the space to `O(1)`.


    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minSwap(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
            const int max_swap = A.size() + 1;
            int not_swap = 0;
            int swap = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i) {
                int tmp_swap = max_swap;
                int tmp_not_swap = max_swap;
                if (A[i] > A[i - 1] && B[i] > B[i - 1]) {
                    // Condition i.a
                    tmp_not_swap = min(tmp_not_swap, not_swap);
                    // Condition i.b
                    tmp_swap = min(tmp_swap, swap + 1);
                }
                if (A[i] > B[i - 1] && B[i] > A[i - 1]) {
                    // Condition ii.a
                    tmp_not_swap = min(tmp_not_swap, swap);
                    // Condition ii.b
                    tmp_swap = min(tmp_swap, not_swap + 1);
                }
                not_swap = tmp_not_swap;
                swap = tmp_swap;
            }
            return min(not_swap, swap);
        }
    };
    ```
