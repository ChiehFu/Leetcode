title: 253. Meeting Rooms II
tags: heap, medium

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. When we have a new meeting, check if there are any room ending before this meeting, 
   1. If there is one, reuse the room and the room will have a new ending time as the end of the current meeting.
   2. It there isn't we just add a room with the ending time as the end of the current meeting.
   3. Use a min-heap to manage the allocated rooms (each ending time in the heap represents a room with that specific ending time), so that we can get the room ending earliest and check if the room can be used for the a new meeting.

    ```c++
    //Min heap
    //Time:  O(NlogN)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
            priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
            sort(begin(intervals), end(intervals), [] (vector<int> &p, vector<int> &q) {
                return p[0] < q[0];
            });
            for (auto &itval : intervals) {
                // If there is a room can be reused, pop it out.
                if (!pq.empty() && itval[0] >= pq.top()) pq.pop();
                // Add the room/ or continue the room popped out with a new ending time.
                pq.push(itval[1]);
            }

            return pq.size();
        }
    };
    ```

2. Other implementation having the similar concepts with the min-heap solution (but not as straight forward as the min-heap one)

    ```c++
    //Two vectors for starting and ending time
    //Time:  O(NlogN)
    //Space: O(N)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
            vector<int> start(intervals.size()), end(intervals.size());
            for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
                start[i] = intervals[i][0];
                end[i] = intervals[i][1];
            }
            sort(start.begin(), start.end());
            sort(end.begin(), end.end());
            
            int end_it = 0;
            int room = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
                room++;
                if (start[i] >= end[end_it]) {
                    room--;
                    end_it++;
                }
            }
            
            return room;
        }
    };
