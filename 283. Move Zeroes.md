Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```c++
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
Note:

- You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use two pointers, `read , write`, when we read a number not equal to 0, write it at the position pointed by `write` and increase `write` by 1.
2. Fill the remaining position haven't been written with zeros
3. In `step 1`, instead of read/write operations, we can also use swap to swap non-zero number with the zero, so that the process of `step 2` can be saved.
```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int write = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                swap(nums[write++], nums[i]);
            }
        }
        
        //while (write < nums.size()) nums[write++] = 0;
    }
};
```
