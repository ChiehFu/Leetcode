title: 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
tags: Hash table, string, hard, two pointers
notebook: Leetcode
---

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:
```c++
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

Example 2:
```c++
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```

Thoughts:
1. Finding a substring that is a permutation of the given set of words 
2. Similar to the question [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

```c++
//Time:  O(N*M*L)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        if (s.empty() || words.empty()) return {};
        
        unordered_map<string, int> dict;
        for (string &word : words) dict[word]++;
        
        int len = words[0].size();
        vector<int> res;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            unordered_map<string, int> m;
            int l = i, r = i;
            // Use a queue to store the words in current substring.
            // So that we don't need to cut the word out of the substring to check it when we want to remove it.
            queue<string> q;
            while (r + len - 1 < s.size()) {
                string str = s.substr(r, len);
                m[str]++;
                q.push(str);
                if (m[str] > dict[str]) {
                    while (l < r) {
                        if (q.front() == str) break;
                        m[q.front()]--;
                        q.pop();
                        l += len;
                    }
                    m[q.front()]--;
                    q.pop();
                    l += len;
                }
                r += len;
                if (r - l == words.size() * len) res.push_back(l);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
