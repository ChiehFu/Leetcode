A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.

Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.
 

Example 1:

Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
Example 2:

Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.

Note:

matrix will be a 2D array of integers.
matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].

Follow up:

- What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
- What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

Thoughts:

Two solutions:

1. Check the next neighborhood in diagonal:
   1. Use `i`, `j` scan through the matrix, for each position `i`, `j`, check if the value is same as the value at the position `i + 1`, `j + 1`.

    ```c++
    //Time:   O(N * M)
    //Space:  O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
            int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
                for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                    if (matrix[i][j] != matrix[i - 1][j - 1])
                        return false;
            return true;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Map the positions in matrix to one diagonal index such that all positions at the same diagonal will have the same diagonal index.
   1. For each diagonal, keep the first value that appears on it, and all positions coming later on this diagonal should have the same value.
   2. Perfectly solve the follow-up situations where each time we can just read one/partial row into the memory.

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N * M)
    //Space: O(N + M)
    class Solution {
        public:
        bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
            if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return true;
            int m = matrix.size();
            int n = matrix[0].size();
            vector<int> num(m + n - 1, -1);
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    int idx = i - j + n - 1;
                    if (num[idx] == -1) num[idx] = matrix[i][j];
                    else {
                        if (num[idx] != matrix[i][j]) return false;
                    }
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    };

    ```
