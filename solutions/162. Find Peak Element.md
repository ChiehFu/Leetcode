title: 162. Find Peak Element
tags: Binary Search, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```
Note:

- Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

Thoughts:
1. Binary search
   1. Pick a middle `m` within the range `[left, right]`:
   2. If `nums[m] < nums[m + 1]`, the peak will be on the right side of `m`, go search the range `[m + 1, right]`.
   3. If `nums[m] > nums[m + 1]`, the peak will be on the left side of `m + 1`, go search the range `[left, m]`.
   4. By the process above, we are guaranteed to find a peak given:
      1. If we find `nums[m] < nums[m + 1]` and go right side: 
         1. If find `i` such that `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`, `nums[i]` will be the peaks.
         2. If we don't find such `i`, means the range `[m + 1, right]` are totally ascending, according to the question, `nums[right + 1] = -∞`, thus `nums[right]` will be a peak.
      2. The same logic can be applied to when we find a descending pair and go left side search for a peak.

```c++
//Time: O(logN)
//Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (nums[m] < nums[m + 1]) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else r = m;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
