title: 503. Next Greater Element II
tags: Stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2..
```

Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over the array twice to search circularly to find the next greater number for each element.
2. We only need to push the element into the stack for the first iteration since for each element, the one pop it out of the stack will be the next greater element for it.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res(nums.size(), -1);
        stack<int> s;
        
        // Iterate over the stack twice, so that we will find the next greater element for each element circularly.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() * 2; i++) {
            // Compute the real index
            int index = i % nums.size();
            // Pop out every element in the stack of which the next greater element is nums[index]
            while (!s.empty() && nums[index] > nums[s.top()]) {
                res[s.top()] = nums[index];
                s.pop();
            }
            // Only push the elements into the stack in first iteration
            if (i < nums.size()) s.push(index);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
