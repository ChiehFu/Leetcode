Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

Example 1:

```
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
```

Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/26/sample_2_1673.png" width="250">

```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75
```

Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/26/sample_3_1673.png" width="250">

```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= hour <= 12
- 0 <= minutes <= 59
- Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Calculate the clockwise degree starting from `12` of the clock for both the hand of hour and minute, and return the smaller angle between two hands.
2. Calculate the degree for minute directly by multiplying the `minutes` by the `degree per unit`.
3. For hour hand, notice that the hour hand also moves between hours as the minute moves, with the total amount of movement proportional to the ratio of `total minutes / 1 hour`.

```Java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    	
    	double degreePerUnit = 360 / 60;
    	double unitPerMinute = 1;
    	double unitPerHour = 5;
    	
    	double clockwiseDegreeOfMinutes = minutes * unitPerMinute * degreePerUnit;
    	double clockwiseDegreeOfHour = hour * unitPerHour * degreePerUnit 
    								+ (minutes * 1.0 / 60) * unitPerHour * degreePerUnit;
//    	System.out.println("Hour: " + clockwiseDegreeOfHour);
//    	System.out.println("Minutes: " + clockwiseDegreeOfMinutes);
		double degree = Math.abs(clockwiseDegreeOfMinutes - clockwiseDegreeOfHour);
		degree = Math.min(degree, 360 - degree);
        return degree;
    }
}
