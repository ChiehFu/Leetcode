Given a fixed length array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return anything from your function.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

Note:

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10000
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 9

----------
Thoughts:
1. Calculate the index `last` for the last element after duplicating the zero in the array.
2. Iterate the array backwards, and move the `last` at the same time, the `last` will be the index of the final position of the current value.
3. If the `last < n, n = arr.size()`, write the current at the position `last`.
4. If the current value is `0`, repeat the step 3 for an extra `0`.

```c++
//Time:  O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    void duplicateZeros(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size(), wrt = n + count(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (--wrt < n) arr[wrt] = arr[i];
            if (arr[i] == 0 && --wrt < n) {
                arr[wrt] = arr[i];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
