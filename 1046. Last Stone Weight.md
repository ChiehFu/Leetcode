title: 1046. Last Stone Weight
tags: heap, bucket sort, Easy
notebook: Leetcode
---

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
```
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 ```

Note:

- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

Thoughts:
1. Heap solution
```c++
// Max-Heap
//Time:  O(NlogN)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        for (auto s : stones) pq.push(s);
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int p1 = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            int p2 = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            int left = abs(p1 - p2);
            if (left != 0) pq.push(left);
        }
        return (!pq.empty())? pq.top():0;
    }
};
```
2. Bucket sort/ Counting sort

```c++
//Bucket sort/ Counting sort
//Time: O(1000) ~ O(1000^2) -> O(N)
//Space: O(1001) -> O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
        // Countint sort
        vector<int> bucket(1001, 0);
        for (auto s : stones) bucket[s]++;
        
        int i = bucket.size() - 1;
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        while (i >= 1) {
            // Take two integer from the bucket
            while (i >= 1 && (p1 == 0 || p2 == 0)) {
                if (bucket[i] > 0) {
                    bucket[i]--;
                    if (p1 == 0) {
                        p1 = i;
                    } else {
                        p2 = i;
                    }
                }
                // Move to next bucket if current bucket contains 0 element
                if (bucket[i] == 0) i--;
            }
            // If we only find one number
            if (p2 == 0) break;
            
            int n = abs(p1 - p2);
            if (n) {
                bucket[n]++;
                // Current index is equal or smaller than p2, but n could be greater than p2, so move the index back to the biggest one of i and n
                i = max(i, n);
            }
            
            // Reset to zero
            p1 = 0;
            p2 = 0;
        }
        return p1;
    }
};
```
