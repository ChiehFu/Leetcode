title: 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
tags: Linked List, Stack, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Example:

```c++
Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
```
Explanation for the above example:

Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:

Thoughts:

Given it nested structure, we can solve it by:
1. Recursive solution
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(L), number of nested layers 

    /*
    // Definition for a Node.
    class Node {
    public:
        int val;
        Node* prev;
        Node* next;
        Node* child;

        Node() {}

        Node(int _val, Node* _prev, Node* _next, Node* _child) {
            val = _val;
            prev = _prev;
            next = _next;
            child = _child;
        }
    };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        Node* flatten(Node* head) {
            helper(head);
            return head;
        }
        Node* helper(Node* node) {
            if (!node) return node;
            
            Node *cur = node;
            Node *last = node;
            
            while (cur) {
                // Keep track of the tail of the current linked list 
                last = cur;
                // If there is a child, solve the sub problem and recur back, merge the current list with the sub list
                if (cur->child) {
                    
                    Node* next = cur->next;
                    Node* sub_tail = helper(cur->child);
                    
                    // Build the connection between cur and the head of the sub list(cur->child), set cur->child to nullptr
                    cur->next = cur->child;
                    cur->child->prev = cur;
                    cur->child = nullptr; 
                    
                    // If next is not null, build the links between the sub tail we got from sub linked list
                    // Otherwise, the tail should be updated to the sub tail we got from the sub linked list
                    if (next) {
                        next->prev = sub_tail;
                        sub_tail->next = next;
                    } else last = sub_tail;

                    cur = next;
                } else cur = cur->next;
            }
            
            // return the tail of the current sub linked list
            return last;
        }
    };

    /*
                                *
    1---2---3             4---5---6--NULL
            |             | 
            7---8    9---10--NULL
                |    |
                11--12--NULL
                
    */
    ```
2. Iterative with stack (similar to solution 1)
    ```c++
    /*
    //Time:  O(N)
    //Space: O(L), number of nested layers 

    // Definition for a Node.
    class Node {
    public:
        int val;
        Node* prev;
        Node* next;
        Node* child;

        Node() {}

        Node(int _val, Node* _prev, Node* _next, Node* _child) {
            val = _val;
            prev = _prev;
            next = _next;
            child = _child;
        }
    };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        Node* flatten(Node* head) {
            if (!head) return head;
            stack<Node*> s;
            Node* cur = head;
            while (cur) {
                if (cur->child) {
                    // Push the cur->next into a stack
                    s.push(cur->next);

                    // set cur->next to cur->child and set cur->child to a nullptr
                    cur->next = cur->child;
                    cur->child = nullptr;
                    // build the prev for current next
                    if (cur->next) cur->next->prev = cur;
                } else if (cur->next == nullptr && !s.empty()) {
                    // If we reach the end of current layer, link cur to the node of the previous layer stored in the stack
                    cur->next = s.top(); s.pop();

                    // Build the prev link if cur->next is not null
                    if (cur->next) cur->next->prev = cur;
                }

                // move to the next 
                cur = cur->next;
            }
            return head;
        }
    };
    ```
1. Iterative (merge two layers one time)

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(2N)
    //Space: O(1)

    /*
    // Definition for a Node.
    class Node {
    public:
        int val;
        Node* prev;
        Node* next;
        Node* child;

        Node() {}

        Node(int _val, Node* _prev, Node* _next, Node* _child) {
            val = _val;
            prev = _prev;
            next = _next;
            child = _child;
        }
    };
    */
    class Solution {
    public:
        Node* flatten(Node* head) {
            if (!head) return head;
            Node* cur = head;
            while (cur) {
                if (!cur->child) cur = cur->next;
                else {
                    // Each time, when we find a child(sub layer), we just merge the current layer with that sub layer, and move the cur forward
                    // Every layer deeper than first layer will eventually be reduced and merged into the first layer

                    // Find the tail of the child
                    Node* tmp = cur->child;
                    while (tmp->next) tmp = tmp->next;
                    
                    Node* next = cur->next;
                    cur->next = cur->child;
                    cur->child->prev = cur;
                    cur->child = nullptr;
                    
                    if (next) {
                        tmp->next = next;
                        next->prev = tmp;
                    }
                    
                    cur = cur->next;
                }
            }
            return head;
        }
    };
    ```
