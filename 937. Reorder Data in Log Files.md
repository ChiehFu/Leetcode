title: 937. Reorder Data in Log Files
tags: sort, Easy 
notebook: Leetcode

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= logs.length <= 100
- 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
- logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use stable sort and implement a comparator to keep all digit-logs in the original order.
2. The signature of comparator of the stable_sort must look like `bool cmp(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);`, the parameters should be passed by constant and can't be modified.


    ```c++
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
            auto cmp = [] (const string &a, const string &b) {
                int idx_a = a.find_first_of(' ');
                int idx_b = b.find_first_of(' ');
                ++idx_a;
                ++idx_b;
                if (isdigit(a[idx_a]) && isdigit(b[idx_b])) {
                    return false;
                } else if (isdigit(a[idx_a]) || isdigit(b[idx_b])) {
                    return isdigit(b[idx_b])? true : false;
                } else {
                    string sub_a = a.substr(idx_a), sub_b = b.substr(idx_b);
                    return (sub_a == sub_b)? a < b : sub_a < sub_b;
                }
            };
            stable_sort(logs.begin(), logs.end(), cmp);
            return logs;
        }
    };
    ```
