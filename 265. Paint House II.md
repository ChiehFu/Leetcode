title: 265. Paint House II
tags: Dynamic Programming, hard
notebook: Leetcode
---

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:
```
Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

----------
Thoughts:
1. Straight-forward DP solution:
    1. Use `dp[i][j]` represent the best cost for the house `0 - i` and with the `ith` house painted with color `j`.
    ```
    Relations:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][k]) + cost[i][j], where k = all possible colors except for kth color.
    ```
    2. To figure out the best `dp[i][j]`, we need to iterate through all possible colors that `i - 1` th house painted with and the corresponding cost, and find out the best combination that has minimal cost.
    3. The total time complexity will be `O(N * K * K)`, since each house `i` only depends on the previous house `i - 1`, the first dimension of the dp table can be omitted, which brings the space complexity to `O(k)`

    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N * K * K)
    //Space: O(K)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minCostII(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
            if (costs.empty() || costs[0].empty()) return 0;
            int n = costs.size();
            int k = costs[0].size();
            if (k == 1) return costs[0][0];
            int min_cost = INT_MAX;
            vector<int> dp(k, 0);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                vector<int> tmp(k, INT_MAX);
                for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                    // For each color at ith house, try to pair with all colors (except for the same color) at i - 1th house, and find out the best cost
                    for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                        if (l == j) continue;
                        tmp[j] = min(tmp[j], dp[l] + costs[i][j]);
                    }
                    if (i == n - 1) min_cost = min(min_cost, tmp[j]);
                }
                swap(tmp, dp);
            }
            return min_cost;
        }
    };
    ```
2. Optimized solution:
   1. In previous solution, to find the best cost of `ith` house and `jth` color, we have to pull out the costs of `i - 1th` house painted with each possible colors except for the `jth` color, and find the combination that has best cost. 
   2. Actually, we can just keep track of the two colors `a, b` having minimal cost for previous `i - 1th` house, and we can always pick one of the previous color for the `ith` house with `jth` color (i.e., if j == a, pick b as previous color, and vice versa).
   3. This way, for given color, we can pick the previous that yield the best cost in `O(1)`, so the overall time complexity will be `O(N * K)`.
   4. Use a pair to keep the index and cost, so that we can ditch the dp table and bring the space complexity to `O(1)`.
    ```c++
    //Time:  O(N * K)
    //Space: O(1)

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minCostII(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
            if (costs.empty() || costs[0].empty()) return 0;
            int n = costs.size();
            int k = costs[0].size();
            
            // Initial two color cost pairs as {0, 0}
            pair<int, int> cost_1 = {0, 0}, cost_2 = {0, 0};
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                // Use two tmp pairs to find the two best color cost pairs for this ith house 
                pair<int, int> tmp_cost_1 = {-1, -1}, tmp_cost_2 = {-1, -1};
                for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                    int c = (j == cost_1.first)? cost_2.second: cost_1.second;
                    c += costs[i][j];
                    
                    if (tmp_cost_1.first == -1) {
                        tmp_cost_1 = {j, c};
                    } else if (c < tmp_cost_1.second) {
                        swap(tmp_cost_1, tmp_cost_2);
                        tmp_cost_1 = {j, c};
                    } else if (tmp_cost_2.first == -1 || c < tmp_cost_2.second) {
                        tmp_cost_2 = {j, c};
                    }
                        
                }
                // Update the previous pairs to the current pairs
                swap(cost_1, tmp_cost_1);
                swap(cost_2, tmp_cost_2);
            }
            return cost_1.second;
        }
    };
    ```
