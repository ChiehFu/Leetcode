title: 315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self

notebook: Leetcode

You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

Input: [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0] 
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

----------
Thoughts:
3 Solution:
1. Store the element in a binary search tree:
   1. Each parent node keep track of the number of nodes of it's left subtree(those node smaller than itself)
   2. Iterate over the array from right to left
      1. For each value, search the value in the tree and calculate the number of nodes smaller than it.
      2. Insert the value into the tree and update the number of smaller nodes for each node along the path if necessary.
   3. Self-made binary search tree is not self balancing, which means the insertion and query time will be at most `O(N^2)`, use those self-balancing BST instead such as AVL tree.
2. Use a tmp array for storing the value in ascending order and iterate the array from right to left, for each element:
   1. Binary search the value in the tmp array to find how many element that goes before it.
   2. Insert the element into tmp array by the index so that tmp array will in ascending order.
   3. Insertion in array takes `O(N)` time, so the overall time complexity will be `O(N^2)`.
    ```c++
    //Binary Search
    //Time: O(N^2)
    //Space: O(N)
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<int> t, res(nums.size());
            for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
                int left = 0, right = t.size();
                while (left < right) {
                    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                    if (t[mid] >= nums[i]) right = mid;
                    else left = mid + 1;
                }
                res[i] = right;
                t.insert(t.begin() + right, nums[i]);
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
3. [Fenwick tree/Binary indexed tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbafSgetDDk&t=636s)
   1. A tree structure allows `O(logN)` access time.
   2. Store the elements in an array with a index staring from 1
      1. The node with index `i` preserver part of the prefix sum in `[1:i]`.
      2. The index of the parent of the node with index `i` equals to `i + (i & -i)`
      3. When insert/modify the node `i`, update every parent along the path to the root.
      4. When query the node `i` for the prefix sum of the interval `[1:i]`, left shift the index by `i = i - (i&-i)` if `i > 0`, add up every number on the path.
    ```c++
    //Fenwick tree
    //Time: query/insert O(logN)
    //Space: O(K), K = number of unique values
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<int> bit(nums.size() + 1, 0);
            set<int> order(begin(nums), end(nums));
            unordered_map<int, int> index;

            for (auto n : order) index[n] = index.size() + 1;
            vector<int> res;
            for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                res.push_back(query(bit, index[nums[i]] - 1));
                insert(bit, index[nums[i]], 1);
            }
            reverse(begin(res), end(res));
            return res;
        }
        int query(vector<int> &bit, int i) {
            int count = 0;
            while (i > 0) {
                count += bit[i];
                i -= (i&-i);
            }
            return count;
        }
        void insert(vector<int> &bit, int i, int diff) {
            while (i < bit.size()) {
                bit[i] += diff;
                i += (i&-i);
            }
        }
    };
    ```
