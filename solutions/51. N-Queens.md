The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. For each row, we pick one column position to place the queen, and we respectively call the function to solve for the next row in the same fashion.
2. If there is any queen placed on our current row, column, or two diagonals, we can't place the queen at current position. 
3. If we don't find the solution, back track to previous row and retry another choices.
4. If we have placed n queens at n rows, push the board into the answer array.
5. Use a row/column/left diagonal/right diagonal array with to keep track of the line that has been taken, so that we can efficiently check check the validity of each position.

//Space: O(2n)

        // Map the position (i, j) to diagonal index (i - j + n - 1)
        diag = vector<int>(n * 2, 0);
        // Map the position (i, j) to anti-diagoaal index (i + j)       
        anti_diag = vector<int>(n * 2, 0);
