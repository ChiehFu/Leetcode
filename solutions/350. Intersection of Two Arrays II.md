Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```
Example 2:
```c++
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

Note:

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

Thoughts:

2 Solutions:
  1. Hashmap/multiset, time: `O(N1 + N2)`, space: `O(min(N1, N2))`
     1. If use multiset, we need to `erase` single element with specific value, however, don't `erase` element simply by value, erase by the iterator of that specific value instead, as the former will remove every elements having same value at once.
  2. Two Pointers: time: `O(max(N1logN1, N2logn2))`, space: `O(1)`
     1. If the given arrays are sorted, time complexity will reduce to `O(min(N1, N2))`.

Follow up:
- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
  - We can apply two points solution, which will have the time complexity `O(min(N1, N1)`) and space `O(1)`.
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
  - Two points solution is better in comparison to Hashmap solution in terms of both time and space complexity.
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
  - If only nums2 cannot fit in memory, put all elements of nums1 into a HashMap, read chunks of array that fit into the memory, and record the intersections.
  - If both nums1 and nums2 are so huge that neither fit into the memory, sort them individually (external sort), then read 2 elements from each array at a time in memory, record intersections.
  - Use MapReduce two build the hashmap for two arrays, and handle the element in hashmap one by one.

```c++
//Hashmap
//Time: O(N1 + N2)
//Space: O(min(N1, N2))

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        if (nums1.size() > nums2.size()) return intersect(nums2, nums1);
        unordered_map<int, int> s;
        for (int num : nums2) s[num]++;
        vector<int> res;
        for (int num : nums1) {
            if (s[num] > 0) {
                res.push_back(num);
                s[num]--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

```c++
//Two Pointers with sorting
//Time: O(max(N1logN1, N2logn2))
//Space: O(1)

public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        
        sort(begin(nums1), end(nums1));
        sort(begin(nums2), end(nums2));
        
        vector<int> res;
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        while (p1 < nums1.size() && p2 < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[p1] < nums2[p2]) {
                p1++;
            } else if (nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {
                p2++;
            } else {
                res.push_back(nums1[p1]);
                p1++;
                p2++;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
