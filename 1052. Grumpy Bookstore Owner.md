title: 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner
tags: medium, Sliding Window, Array
notebook: Leetcode

Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0.  When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

 

Example 1:

```c++
Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
```

Note:

- 1 <= X <= customers.length == grumpy.length <= 20000
- 0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
- 0 <= grumpy[i] <= 1

----------
Thoughts:
1. So basically we need to find the interval `(l, r)` of length `X` in grumpy, such that the sum of `customers[i], for i subarray and grumpy[i] = 1` is maximized.
2. Use sliding window technique to find the starting index of such interval `(l, r)`.
3. Calculate the total satisfied customers by sum up all `customers[i], if grumpy[i] == 0` and `customers[i], if grumpy[i] == 1 and l <= i <= r`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
        int window_l = 0;
        int best_window_val = 0;
        int window_val = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        
        while (r < grumpy.size()) {
            if (grumpy[r] == 1) {
                window_val += customers[r];
            }
            ++r;
            while (r - l > X) {
                if (grumpy[l] == 1) {
                    window_val -= customers[l];
                }
                ++l;
            }
            if (r - l == X && window_val > best_window_val) {
                best_window_val = window_val;
                window_l = l;
            }
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); ++i) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 0 || (i >= window_l && i < window_l + X)) sum += customers[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
