Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.
```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```
```
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
 ```

Note:

1. graph will have length in range [1, 100].
2. graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
3. graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
4. The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

Thoughts:
1. DFS/BFS tarverse the graph and assign the neighbors of current node to the opposite group.
2. If there is a neighbor has been assign to the group same as current node, return false.
3. A list of edges might contains multiple components that need to be checked, so scan through all nodes and traverse from the node if it hasn't been visited.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        if (graph.empty()) return false;
        vector<int> group(graph.size(), 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
            // If current node has been visited, move on
            if (group[i] != 0) continue;
            // Otherwise, bfs traverse from this node and assign this node to one group first
            queue<int> q;
            q.push(i);
            group[i] = 1;

            while (!q.empty()) {
                int n = q.size();
                while (n--) {
                    int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                    for (auto &v : graph[cur]) {
                        // If the neighbor hasn't been visited and assigned, assign it to the group opposite to the group of the current node
                        if (group[v] == 0) {
                            group[v] = -group[cur];
                            q.push(v);
                        } else { // Otherwise, check if they are in different group
                            if (group[v] * group[cur] > 0) return false;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
