title: 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
tags: Array, hard, Union find
notebook: Leetcode

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
----------
Thoughts:
1. Union Find (Time: O(NlogN), not optimal)
   1. Use hashmap map the value to the `left` and `right` interval currently found (initialize as `{current, current}`)
   2. Iterate through the number, for each number that is not duplicate:
      1. If it's left/right exists, mount their parents under current value
      2. Update the boundary of the current value to be {left boundary of the left value, right boundary of the right value}
      3. Maintain a global value `longest` to store the longest consecutive  interval
   3. Actually, union find can be omitted if we update the new left and right interval for the left-most and right-most values of the current interval as well (so that their boundaries will be updated and don't need to set the current value as their parent to access the newest interval) (see the 2th solution)
2. Hashamp + boundary updating
   1. For the number that is not duplicate, initial it boundary as `{current, current}` and update the left and right boundary from it's left and right values(if exist) `{current.left, current.right} = {(current-1).left, (current+1).right}`.
   2. Update the right boundary value of the left-most element `(current - 1).left` as current's right-most element: `((current-1).left).right = current.right`
   3. Update the left boundary value of the right-most element `(current + 1).right` as current's left-most element: `((current-1).right).left = current.left`
   4. So for the sequence `left, x, x, current, x, right`, after updating, the `{left, right}` boundary of `left, current, and right` will all be `{left, right}` 

```C++
//Hashamp + boundary updating
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int longest = 0;
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> intervals;
        
        for (const auto &num : nums) {
            if (intervals.find(num) != end(intervals)) continue;
            
            int left = num;
            int right = num;
            
            // Update the left and right from num-1 and num+1 (if exist)
            if (intervals.find(num - 1) != end(intervals)) left = intervals[num - 1][0];
            if (intervals.find(num + 1) != end(intervals)) right = intervals[num + 1][1];
            
            //Update num-1, and num+1 (if exist) with the new right and left boundary
            if (left != num) intervals[intervals[num - 1][0]][1] = right;
            if (right != num) intervals[intervals[num + 1][1]][0] = left;
            
            intervals[num] = {left, right};
            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1);
        }
        return longest;
    }
};

```
