title: 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

Example:

``` c++
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

----------
Thoughts:
1. Use `bestBuy[i] and bestSell[i]` to represent the maximum profit we can make in previous i days.
    ```
    bestBuy[i] : Maximum profit which ends with buying on day i or ends
    with buying on any day before i and takes rest until the day i since then.

    bestSell[i] : Maximum profit which ends with selling on day i or ends
    with selling on any day before i and takes rest until the day i since then.
    ```
2. Use negative value for expenses and positive value for incomes.
3. For day i:
    1. The best profit we can make by selling a stock will be
        1. We sell at day ith, `bestBuy[i - 1] + prices[i - 1] (starts from 0)` or
        2. We sell before day ith and rest since then to day ith, `bestSell[i - 1]`
    2. The best profit we can make by buying a stock will be
        1. We buy at day ith, `bestSell[i - 2] - price[i - 1](starts from zero, nagative for spending)` or
        2. We buy before day ith and rest since then to day ith, `bestBuy[i - 1]`
        ```c++
        buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 2] - prices[i - 1]);   
        sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i - 1]);    
        ```
```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        vector<int> bestBuy(prices.size() + 1, 0), bestSell(prices.size() + 1, 0);
        bestBuy[1] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            
            bestBuy[i + 1] = max(bestSell[i - 1] - prices[i], bestBuy[i]);
            bestSell[i + 1] = max(bestBuy[i] + prices[i], bestSell[i]);
        }
        return bestSell[prices.size()];
    }
};
```

3. Optimize to O(1) Space

    For the calculation of day `i`, it only depends on day `i - 1` and day `i - 2`, so it can be optimized to using just O(1) space.
    ```
    Let b2, b1, b0 represent buy[i - 2], buy[i - 1], buy[i]
    Let s2, s1, s0 represent sell[i - 2], sell[i - 1], sell[i]
    ```
```c++
//Time: O(N)
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        int b0 = -prices[0], b1 = b0;
        int s2 = 0, s1 = 0, s0 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            b0 = max(b1, s2 - prices[i]);
            s0 = max(s1, b1 + prices[i]);
            
            b1 = b0;
            s2 = s1;
            s1 = s0;
        }
        return s0;
    }
};
```
