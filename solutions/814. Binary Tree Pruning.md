title: 814. Binary Tree Pruning
tags: Tree, DFS, medium
notebook: Leetcode
---

We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

```
Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.

Note:

- The binary tree will have at most 100 nodes.
- The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.
----------
Thoughts:
1. Traverse the tree post-orderly, for each leaf node, 
   1. Delete it and return `null` to its upstream parent if its value is `0`.
   2. Return itself otherwise.
2. For each non-leaf node(before pruning) as we backtrack from the descendants during the traversal:
   1. If the current node has any children(not deleted), it means there exist `1` in the subtree of that children, so we keep the current node and return it to its parent like step `1.1`.
   2. If current node becomes leaf, we delete it and return `null` to its parent like the step `1.2`.
