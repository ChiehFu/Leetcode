In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.  

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Example 1:
```c++
Input: ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.
```

Note:

- 1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000
- 0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length
- times is a strictly increasing array with all elements in [0, 10^9].
- TopVotedCandidate.q is called at most 10000 times per test case.
- TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) is always called with t >= times[0].

----------
Thoughts:
1. Iterate over `persons` from the index `[0:n]`, count the number of votes for each person at time point `i`, and map the time point `times[i]` to the lead at time point `i`.
2. Binary search the time no later than time, and return the winner mapped to that time.

```c++
//Time: O(N) for initialization, O(1) for query
//Space: O(N)

class TopVotedCandidate {
public:
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int>& persons, vector<int>& times) {
        vector<int> vote(persons.size() + 1, 0);
        int win = persons[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.size(); i++) {
            if (++vote[persons[i]] >= vote[win]) {
                win = persons[i];
            }
            winner_[times[i]] = win;
        }
    }
    
    int q(int t) {
        return (--winner_.upper_bound(t))->second;
    }
private:
    map<int, int> winner_;
};


```
